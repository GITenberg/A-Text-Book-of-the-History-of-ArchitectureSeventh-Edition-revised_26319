PRIMITIVE AND PREHISTORIC ARCHITECTURE.</h3>

<p class = "books">
<span class = "smallcaps">Books Recommended</span>: Desor, <i>Les
constructions lacustres du lac de Neufchatel</i>. Fergusson, <i>Rude
Stone Monuments</i>. R.&nbsp;C. Hoare, <i>Ancients Wiltshire</i>. Lyell,
<i>The Antiquity of Man</i>. Lubbock, <i>Prehistoric Times</i>.
Nadaillac, <i>Prehistoric America</i>. Rougemont, <i>L’age du
Bronze</i>. Tylor, <i>Primitive Culture</i>.</p>

<p><b>EARLY BEGINNINGS.</b> It is impossible to trace the early stages
of the process by which true architecture grew out of the first rude
attempts of man at building. The oldest existing monuments of
architecture&mdash;those of Chaldæa and Egypt&mdash;belong to an
advanced civilization. The rude and elementary structures built by
savage and barbarous peoples, like the Hottentots or the tribes of
Central Africa, are not in themselves works of architecture, nor is any
instance known of the evolution of a civilized art from such beginnings.
So far as the monuments testify, no savage people ever raised itself to
civilization, and no primitive method of building was ever developed
into genuine architecture, except by contact with some existing
civilization of which it appropriated the spirit, the processes, and the
forms. How the earliest architecture came into existence is as yet an
unsolved problem.</p>

<p><b>PRIMITIVE ARCHITECTURE</b> is therefore a subject for the
archæologist rather than the historian of art, and needs here only the
briefest mention. If we may judge of the condition of the primitive
races of antiquity by that of the savage and barbarous peoples of our
own time, they required
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
<a name = "page2" id = "page2"> </a>
only the simplest kinds of buildings, though the purposes which they
served were the same as those of later times in civilized communities.
A&nbsp;hut or house for shelter, a&nbsp;shrine of some sort for worship,
a&nbsp;stockade for defence, a&nbsp;cairn or mound over the grave of the
chief or hero, were provided out of the simplest materials, and these
often of a perishable nature. Poles supplied the framework; wattles,
skins, or mud the walls; thatching or stamped earth the roof. Only the
simplest tools were needed for such elementary construction. There was
ingenuity and patient labor in work of this kind; but there was no
planning, no fitting together into a complex organism of varied
materials shaped with art and handled with science. Above all, there was
no progression toward higher ideals of fitness and beauty. Rudimentary
art displayed itself mainly in objects of worship, or in carvings on
canoes and weapons, executed as talismans to ward off misfortune or to
charm the unseen powers; but even this art was sterile and never grew of
itself into civilized and progressive art.</p>

<p>Yet there must have been at some point in the remote past an
exception to this rule. Somewhere and somehow the people of Egypt must
have developed from crude beginnings the architectural knowledge and
resource which meet us in the oldest monuments, though every vestige of
that early age has apparently perished. But although nothing has come
down to us of the actual work of the builders who wrought in the
primitive ages of mankind, there exist throughout Europe and Asia almost
countless monuments of a primitive character belonging to relatively
recent times, but executed before the advent of historic civilization to
the regions where they are found. A&nbsp;general resemblance among them
suggests a common heritage of traditions from the hoariest antiquity,
and throws light on the probable character of the transition from
barbaric to civilized architecture.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
<a name = "page3" id = "page3"> </a>
<p><b>PREHISTORIC MONUMENTS.</b> These monuments vary widely as well as
in excellence; some of them belong to Roman or even Christian times;
others to a much remoter period. They are divided into two principal
classes, the megalithic structures and lake dwellings. The latter class
may be dismissed with the briefest mention. It comprises a considerable
number of very primitive houses or huts built on wooden piles in the
lakes of Switzerland and several other countries in both hemispheres,
and forming in some cases villages of no mean size. Such villages, built
over the water for protection from attack, are mentioned by the writers
of antiquity and portrayed on Assyrian reliefs. The objects found in
them reveal an incipient but almost stationary civilization, extending
back from three thousand to five thousand years or more, and lasting
through the ages of stone and bronze down into historic times.</p>

<p>The <b>megalithic</b> remains of Europe and Asia are far more
important. They are very widely distributed, and consist in most cases
of great blocks of stone arranged in rows, circles, or avenues,
sometimes with huge lintels resting upon them. Upright stones without
lintels are called <i>menhirs</i>; standing in pairs with lintels they
are known as <i>dolmens</i>; the circles are called <i>cromlechs</i>.
Some of the stones are of gigantic size, some roughly hewn into shape;
others left as when quarried. Their age and purpose have been much
discussed without reaching positive results. It is probable that, like
the lake dwellings, they cover a long range of time, reaching from the
dawn of recorded history some thousands of years back into the unknown
past, and that they were erected by races which have disappeared before
the migrations to which Europe owes her present populations. That most
of them were in some way connected with the worship of these prehistoric
peoples is generally admitted; but whether as temples, tombs, or
memorials
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
<a name = "page4" id = "page4"> </a>
of historical or mythical events cannot, in all cases, be positively
asserted. They were not dwellings or palaces, and very few were even
enclosed buildings. They are imposing by the size and number of their
immense stones, but show no sign of advanced art, or of conscious
striving after beauty of design. The small number of “carved stones,”
bearing singular ornamental patterns, symbolic or mystical rather than
decorative in intention, really tends to prove this statement rather
than to controvert it. It is not impossible that the dolmens were
generally intended to be covered by mounds of earth. This would group
them with the tumuli referred to below, and point to a sepulchral
purpose in their erection. Some antiquaries, Fergusson among them,
contend that many of the European circles and avenues were intended as
battle-monuments or trophies.</p>

<p>There are also <b>walls</b> of great antiquity in various parts of
Europe, intended for fortification; the most important of these in
Greece and Italy will be referred to in later chapters. They belong to a
more advanced art, some of them even deserving to be classed among works
of archaic architecture.</p>

<p>The <b>tumuli</b>, or burial mounds, which form so large a part of
the prehistoric remains of both continents, are interesting to the
architect only as revealing the prototypes of the pyramids of Egypt and
the subterranean tombs of Mycenæ and other early Greek centres. The
piling of huge cairns or commemorative heaps of stone is known from the
Scriptures and other ancient writings to have been a custom of the
greatest antiquity. The pyramids and the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus are
the most imposing and elaborate outgrowths of this practice, of which
the prehistoric tumuli are the simpler manifestations.</p>

<p>These crude and elementary products of undeveloped civilizations have
no place, however, in any list of genuine architectural works. They
belong rather to the domain of
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
<a name = "page5" id = "page5"> </a>
archæology and ethnology, and have received this brief mention only as
revealing the beginnings of the builder’s art, and the wide gap that
separates them from that genuine architecture which forms the subject of
the following chapters.</p>

<p class = "monuments">
<b>MONUMENTS</b>: The most celebrated in England are at Avebury, an
avenue, large and small circles, barrows, and the great tumuli of
Bartlow and Silbury “Hills;” at Stonehenge, on Salisbury Plain, great
megalithic circles and many barrows; “Sarsen stones” at Ashdown; tumuli,
dolmens, chambers, and circles in Derbyshire. In Ireland, many cairns
and circles. In Scotland, circles and barrows in the Orkney Islands. In
France, Carnac and Lokmariaker in Brittany are especially rich in
dolmens, circles, and avenues. In Scandinavia, Germany, and Italy, in
India and in Africa, are many similar remains.</p>

<p><b>LAND AND PEOPLE.</b> As long ago as 5000 <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span>, the Egyptians were a people already highly
civilized, and skilled in the arts of peace and war. The narrow valley
of the Nile, fertilized by the periodic overflow of the river, was
flanked by rocky heights, nearly vertical in many places, which afforded
abundance of excellent building stone, while they both isolated the
Egyptians and protected them from foreign aggression. At the Delta,
however, the valley widened out, with the falling away of these heights,

<p>I. <span class = "smallcaps">The Ancient Empire</span> (cir.

<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
<a name = "page7" id = "page7"> </a>
<p>The Hyksos invasion, or incursion of the Shepherd Kings, interrupted
the current of Egyptian art history for a period of unknown length,
probably not less than four or five centuries.</p>

<p>III. <span class = "smallcaps">The Second Theban Monarchy</span>
(1700?-1000 <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>), comprising the
eighteenth to twentieth dynasties inclusive, was the great period of
Egyptian history; the age of conquests and of vast edifices.</p>

<p>IV. <span class = "smallcaps">The Decadence</span> or <span class =

(Saitic, Bubastid, Ethiopic, etc.), reigning at Sais, Tanis, and
Bubastis, and the Persian conquest; a&nbsp;period almost barren of
important monuments.</p>

Roman dominations.</p>


<p><b>THE ANCIENT EMPIRE: THE PYRAMIDS.</b> The great works of this
period are almost exclusively sepulchral, and include the most ancient
buildings of which we have any remains. While there is little of
strictly architectural art, the overwhelming size and majesty of the
Pyramids, and the audacity and skill shown in their construction,
entitle them to the first place in any sketch of this period. They
number over a hundred, scattered in six groups, from Abu-Roash in the
north to Meidoum in the south, and are of various shapes and sizes. They
are all royal tombs and belong to the first twelve dynasties; each
contains a sepulchral chamber, and each at one time possessed a small
chapel adjacent to it, but this has, in almost every case, perished.</p>

<p>Three pyramids surpass all the rest by their prodigious size; these
are at Ghizeh and belong to the fourth dynasty. They are known by the
names of their builders; the oldest and greatest being that of
<b>Cheops</b>, or Khufu;<a class = "tag" name = "tag1" id = "tag1" href

that of <b>Chephren</b>, or Khafra; and the third, that of
<b>Mycerinus</b>, or Menkhara. Other smaller ones stand at the feet of
these giants.</p>

<p>The base of the “Great Pyramid” measures 764 feet on a side; its
height is 482 feet, and its volume must have originally been nearly
three and one-half million cubic yards (Fig.&nbsp;1). It is constructed
of limestone upon a plateau of rock levelled to receive it, and was
finished externally, like its two neighbors, with a coating of polished
stone, supposed by some to have been disposed in bands of different
colored granites, but of which it was long ago despoiled. It contained
three principal chambers and an elaborate system of inclined passages,
all executed in finely cut granite and limestone. The sarcophagus was in
the uppermost chamber, above which the superincumbent weight was
relieved by open spaces and a species of rudimentary arch of <span class
= "sans">Λ</span>-shape (Fig.&nbsp;2). The other two pyramids differ
from that of Cheops in the details of their arrangement and in size, not
in the principle of their construction. Chephren is 454 feet high, with
a base 717
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
<a name = "page9" id = "page9"> </a>
feet square. Mycerinus, which still retains its casing of pink granite,
is but 218 feet in height, with a base 253 feet on a side.</p>

<p>Among the other pyramids there is considerable variety both of type
and material. At Sakkarah is one 190 feet high, constructed in six
unequal steps on a slightly oblong base measuring nearly 400 × 357 feet.
It was attributed by Mariette to Ouenephes, of the first dynasty, though
now more generally ascribed to Senefrou of the third. At Abu-Seir and
Meidoum are other stepped pyramids; at Dashour is one having a broken
slope, the lower part steeper than the upper. Several at Meroë with
unusually steep slopes belong to the Ethiopian dynasties of the
Decadence. A&nbsp;number of pyramids are built of brick.</p>

<p><b>TOMBS.</b> The Ancient Empire has also left us a great number of
tombs of the type known as <i>Mastabas</i>. These are oblong rectangular
structures of stone or brick with slightly inclined sides and flat
ceilings. They uniformly face the east, and are internally divided into
three parts; the chamber or chapel, the <i>serdab</i>, and the well. In
the first of these, next the entrance, were placed the offerings made to
the <i>Ka</i> or “double,” for whom
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
<a name = "page10" id = "page10"> </a>
also scenes of festivity or worship were carved and painted on its walls
to minister to his happiness in his incorporeal life. The serdabs, or
secret inner chambers, of which there were several in each mastaba,
contained statues of the defunct, by which the existence and identity of
the Ka were preserved. Finally came the well, leading to the mummy
chamber, deep underground, which contained the sarcophagus. The
sarcophagi, both of this and later ages, are good examples of the minor
architecture of Egypt; many of them are panelled in imitation of wooden
construction and richly decorated with color, symbols, and
hieroglyphs.</p>

<p><b>OTHER MONUMENTS.</b> Two other monuments of the Ancient Empire
also claim attention: the <b>Sphinx</b> and the adjacent so-called
“<b>Sphinx temple</b>” at Ghizeh. The first of these, a&nbsp;huge
sculpture carved from the rock, represents Harmachis in the form of a
human-headed lion. It is ordinarily partly buried in the sand; is 70
feet long by 66 feet high, and forms one of the most striking monuments
of Egyptian art. Close to it lie the nearly buried ruins of the temple
once supposed to be that of the Sphinx, but now proved by Petrie to have
been erected in connection with the second pyramid. The plan and present
aspect of this venerable edifice are shown in Figs. 3 and&nbsp;4. The
hall was roofed with stone lintels carried on sixteen square monolithic
piers of alabaster. The whole was buried in a rectangular mass of
masonry and revetted internally with alabaster, but was wholly destitute
internally as well as externally of decoration or even of mouldings.
With the exception of scanty remains of a few of the pyramid-temples or
chapels, and the
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
<a name = "page11" id = "page11"> </a>
temple discovered by Petrie in Meidoum, it is the only survival from the
temple architecture of that early age.</p>

FIG. 5.&mdash;TOMB AT ABYDOS.</p>

<p><b>THE MIDDLE EMPIRE: TOMBS.</b> The monuments of this period, as of
the preceding, are almost wholly sepulchral. We now encounter two types
of tombs. One, structural and pyramidal, is represented by many examples
at Abydos, the most venerated of all the burial grounds of Egypt
(Fig.&nbsp;5). All of these are built of brick, and are of moderate size
and little artistic interest. The second type is that of tombs cut in
the vertical cliffs of the west bank of the Nile Valley. The entrance to
these faces eastward as required by tradition; the remoter end of the
excavation pointing toward the land of the Sun of Night. But such
tunnels only become works of architecture when, in addition to the
customary mural paintings, they receive a decorative treatment in the
design of their structural forms.

<img src = "images/fig6.png" width = "252" height = "187"
alt = "see caption and text"><br>
FIG. 6.&mdash;TOMB AT BENI-HASSAN.</span>
Such a treatment appears in several tombs at Beni-Hassan, in which
columns are reserved in cutting away the rock, both in the
chapel-chambers and in the vestibules or porches which precede them.
These columns are polygonal in some cases, clustered
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
<a name = "page12" id = "page12"> </a>
in others. The former type, with eight, sixteen, or thirty-two sides (in
these last the <i>arrises</i> or edges are emphasized by a slight
concavity in each face, like embryonic fluting), have a square abacus,
suggesting the Greek Doric order, and giving rise to the name
<i>proto-Doric</i> (Fig.&nbsp;6). Columns of this type are also found at
Karnak, Kalabshé, Amada, and Abydos. A&nbsp;reminiscence of primitive
wood construction is seen in the dentils over the plain architrave of
the entrance, which in other respects recalls the triple entrances to
certain mastabas of the Old Empire. These dentils are imitations of the
ends of rafters, and to some archæologists suggest a wooden origin for
the whole system of columnar design. But these rock-cut shafts and heavy
architraves in no respect resemble wooden prototypes, but point rather
to an imitation cut in the rock of a well-developed, pre-existing system
of stone construction, some of whose details, however, were undoubtedly
derived from early methods of building in wood. The vault was below the
chapel and reached by a separate entrance. The serdab was replaced by a
niche in which was the figure of the defunct carved from the native
rock. Some of the
<span class = "pagenum">13</span>
<a name = "page13" id = "page13"> </a>
tombs employed in the chapel-chamber columns of quatrefoil section with
capitals like clustered buds (Fig.&nbsp;7), and this type became in the
next period one of the most characteristic forms of Egyptian
architecture.</p>

FIG. 7.&mdash;SECTION AND HALF-PLAN OF A TOMB AT BENI-HASSAN.</p>


<p><b>TEMPLES.</b> Of the temples of this period only two have left any
remains of importance. Both belong to the twelfth dynasty (cir. 2200
<span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>). Of one of these many badly
shattered fragments have been found in the ruins of Bubastis; these show
the clustered type of lotus-bud column mentioned above. The other, of
which a few columns have been identified among the ruins of the Great
Temple at Karnak, constituted the oldest part of that vast agglomeration
of religious edifices, and employed columns of the so-called proto-Doric
type. From these remains it appears that structural stone columns as
well as those cut in the rock were used at this early period (2200 <span
class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>). Indeed, it is probable that the whole
architectural system of the New Empire was based on models developed in
the age we are considering; that the use of multiplied columns of
various types and the building of temples of complex plan adorned with
colossal statues, obelisks, and painted reliefs, were perfectly
understood and practised in this period. But the works it produced have
perished, having been most probably demolished to make way for the more
sumptuous edifices of later times.</p>


<p><b>THE NEW EMPIRE.</b> This was the grand age of Egyptian
architecture and history. An extraordinary series of mighty men ruled
the empire during a long period following the expulsion of the Hyksos
usurpers. The names of Thothmes, Amenophis, Hatasu, Seti, and Rameses
made glorious the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties. Foreign conquests
in Ethiopia, Syria, and Assyria enlarged the territory and increased the
splendor of the empire. The majority of the most impressive ruins of
Egypt belong to this period, and it was in these buildings that the
characteristic
<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
<a name = "page14" id = "page14"> </a>
elements of Egyptian architecture were brought to perfection and carried
out on the grandest scale.</p>

<p><b>TOMBS OF THE NEW EMPIRE.</b> Some of these are structural, others
excavated; both types displaying considerable variety in arrangement and
detail. The rock-cut tombs of Bab-el-Molouk, among which are twenty-five
royal sepulchres, are striking both by the simplicity of their openings
and the depth and complexity of their shafts, tunnels, and chambers.
From the pipe-like length of their tunnels they have since the time of
Herodotus been known by the name <i>syrinx</i>. Every precaution was
taken to lead astray and baffle the intending violator of their
sanctity. They penetrated hundreds of feet into the rock; their
chambers, often formed with columns and vault-like roofs, were
resplendent with colored reliefs and ornament destined to solace and
sustain the shadowy Ka until the soul itself, the Ba, should arrive
before the tribunal of Osiris, the Sun of Night. Most impressively do
these brilliant pictures,<a class = "tag" name = "tag2" id = "tag2" href
= "#note2">2</a> intended to be forever shut away from human eyes,
attest the sincerity of the Egyptian belief and the conscientiousness of
the art which it inspired.</p>

<p>While the tomb of the private citizen was complete in itself,
containing the Ka-statues and often the chapel, as well as the mummy,
the royal tomb demanded something more elaborate in scale and
arrangement. In some cases
<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
<a name = "page15" id = "page15"> </a>
external structures of temple-form took the place of the underground
chapel and serdab. The royal effigy, many times repeated in painting and
sculpture throughout this temple-like edifice, and flanking its gateways
with colossal seated figures, made buried Ka-statues unnecessary. Of
these sepulchral temples three are of the first magnitude. They are that
of <b>Queen Hatasu</b> (XVIIIth dynasty) at Deir-el-Bahari; that of
<b>Rameses II.</b> (XIXth dynasty), the <b>Ramesseum</b>, near by to the
southwest; and that of <b>Rameses III.</b> (XXth dynasty) at Medinet
Abou still further to the southwest. Like the tombs, these were all on
the west side of the Nile; so also was the sepulchral temple of
Amenophis III.<!-- invisible . --> (XVIIIth dynasty), the
<b>Amenopheum</b>, of which hardly a trace remains except the two seated
colossi which, rising from the Theban plain, have astonished travellers
from the times of Pausanias and Strabo down to our own. These mutilated
figures, one of which has been known ever since classic times as the
“vocal Memnon,” are 56 feet high, and once flanked the entrance to the
forecourt of the temple of Amenophis. The plan of the Ramesseum, with
its sanctuary, hypostyle hall, and forecourts, its pylons and obelisks,
is shown in Figure&nbsp;8, and may be compared with those of other
temples given on pp. 17 and 18. That of Medinet Abou resembles it
closely. The Ramesseum occupies a rectangle of 590 × 182 feet; the
temple of Medinet Abou measures 500 × 160 feet, not counting the extreme
width of the entrance pylons. The temple of Hatasu at Deir-el-Bahari is
partly excavated and partly structural, a&nbsp;model which is also
followed on a smaller scale in several lesser tombs. Such an edifice is
called a <i>hemispeos</i>.</p>

<p><b>TEMPLES.</b> The surpassing glory of the New Empire was its great
temples. Some of them were among the most stupendous creations of
structural art. To temples rather than palaces were the resources and
energies of the kings devoted, and successive monarchs found no more
splendid outlet for their piety and ambition than the founding of new
temples or the extension and adornment of those already existing. By the
forced labor of thousands of fellaheen (the system is in force to this
day and is known as the <i>corvée</i>) architectural piles of vast
extent could be erected within the lifetime of a monarch. As in the
tombs the internal walls bore pictures for the contemplation of the Ka,
so in the temples the external walls, for the glory of the king and the
delectation of the people, were covered with colored reliefs reciting
the monarch’s glorious deeds. Internally the worship and attributes of
the gods were represented in a similar manner, in endless iteration.</p>

FIG. 9.&mdash;TEMPLE OF EDFOU. PLAN.</p>

<p><b>THE TEMPLE SCHEME.</b> This is admirably shown in the temple of
Khonsu, at Karnak, built by Rameses III. (XXth dynasty), and in the
temple of Edfou (Figs. 9 and 10), though this belongs to the Roman
period. It comprised a sanctuary or <i>sekos</i>, a&nbsp;hypostyle
(columnar) hall, known as the “hall of assembly,” and a forecourt
preceded by a double pylon or
<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
<a name = "page17" id = "page17"> </a>
gateway. Each of these parts might be made more or less complex in
different temples, but the essential features are encountered everywhere
under all changes of form. The building of a temple began with the
sanctuary, which contained the sacred chamber and the shrine of the god,
with subordinate rooms for the priests and for various rites and
functions. These chambers were low, dark, mysterious, accessible only to
the priests and king. They were given a certain dignity by being raised
upon a sort of platform above the general level, and reached by a few
steps. They were sumptuously decorated internally with ritual pictures
in relief. The hall was sometimes loftier, but set on a slightly lower
level; its massive columns supported a roof of stone lintels, and light
was admitted either through clearstory windows under the roof of a
central portion higher than the sides, as at Karnak, or over a low
screen-wall built between the columns of the front row, as at Edfou and
Denderah. This method was peculiar to the Ptolemaic and Roman periods.
The court was usually surrounded
<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
<a name = "page18" id = "page18"> </a>
by a single or double colonnade; sometimes, however, this colonnade only
flanked the sides or fronted the hall, or again was wholly wanting. The
<i>pylons</i> were twin buttress-like masses flanking the entrance gate
of the court. They were shaped like oblong truncated pyramids, crowned
by flaring cornices, and were decorated on the outer face with masts
carrying banners, with obelisks, or with seated colossal figures of the
royal builder. An avenue of sphinxes formed the approach to the
entrance, and the whole temple precinct was surrounded by a wall,
usually of crude brick, pierced by one or more gates with or without
pylons. The piety of successive monarchs was displayed in the addition
of new hypostyle halls, courts, pylons, or obelisks, by which the temple
was successively extended in length, and sometimes also in width, by the
increased dimensions of the new courts. The great Temple of Karnak most
strikingly illustrates this growth. Begun by Osourtesen (XIIth dynasty)
more than 2000 years <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>, it was not
completed in its present form until the time of the Ptolemies, when the
last of the pylons and external gates were erected.</p>

FIG. 10.&mdash;TEMPLE OF EDFOU. SECTION.</p>

<p>The variations in the details of this general type were numerous.
Thus, at El Kab, the temple of Amenophis III.
<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
<a name = "page19" id = "page19"> </a>
has the sekos and hall but no forecourt. At Deir-el-Medineh the hall of
the Ptolemaic Hathor-temple is a mere porch in two parts, while the
enclosure within the circuit wall takes the place of the forecourt. At
Karnak all the parts were repeated several times, and under Amenophis
III. (XVIIIth dynasty) a&nbsp;wing was built at a nearly right angle to
the main structure. At Luxor, to a complete typical temple were added
three aisles of an unfinished hypostyle hall, and an elaborate
forecourt, whose axis is inclined to that of the other buildings, owing
to a bend of the river at that point. At Abydos a complex sanctuary of
many chambers extends southeast at right angles to the general mass, and
the first court is without columns. But in all these structures a
certain unity of effect is produced by the lofty pylons, the flat roofs
diminishing in height over successive portions from the front to the
sanctuary, the sloping windowless walls covered with carved and painted
pictures, and the dim and massive interiors of the columnar halls.</p>

<p><b>TEMPLES OF KARNAK.</b> Of these various temples that of
<b>Amen-Ra</b> is incomparably the largest and most imposing. Its
construction extended through the whole duration of the New Empire, of
whose architecture it is a splendid <i>résumé</i> (Fig. 11). Its extreme
length is 1,215 feet, and its greatest width 376 feet. The sanctuary and
its accessories, mainly built by Thothmes&nbsp;I. and Thothmes III.,
cover an area nearly 456 × 290 feet in extent, and comprise two
hypostyle halls and countless smaller halls and chambers. It is preceded
by a narrow columnar vestibule and two pylons enclosing a columnar
atrium and two obelisks. This is entered from the <b>Great Hypostyle
Hall</b> (<i>h</i> in Fig. 11; Fig. 12), the noblest single work of
Egyptian architecture, measuring 340 × 170 feet, and containing 134
columns in sixteen rows, supporting a massive stone roof. The central
columns with bell-capitals are 70 feet high and nearly 12 feet in
diameter; the others are smaller and lower, with lotus-bud capitals,
supporting
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
<a name = "page20" id = "page20"> </a>
a&nbsp;roof lower than that over the three central aisles.
A&nbsp;clearstory of stone-grated windows makes up the difference in
height between these two roofs. The interior, thus lighted, was splendid
with painted reliefs, which helped not only to adorn the hall but to
give scale to its massive parts. The whole stupendous creation was the
work of three kings&mdash;Rameses&nbsp;I., Seti&nbsp;I., and Rameses II.
(XIXth dynasty).</p>

<p>In front of it was the great court, flanked by columns, and still
showing the ruins of a central avenue of colossal pillars begun, but
never completed, by the Bubastid kings of the XXIId dynasty. One or two
smaller structures and the curious lateral wing built by Amenophis III.,
interrupt the otherwise orderly and symmetrical advance of this plan
from the sanctuary to the huge first pylon (last in point of date)
erected by the Ptolemies.</p>

<p>The smaller temple of Khonsu, south of that of Amen-Ra, has already
been alluded to as a typical example of templar design. Next to Karnak
in importance comes the <b>Temple of Luxor</b> in its immediate
neighborhood. It has two forecourts adorned with double-aisled
colonnades and
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
<a name = "page21" id = "page21"> </a>
connected by what seems to be an unfinished hypostyle hall. The
<b>Ramesseum</b> and the temples of <b>Medinet Abou</b> and
<b>Deir-El-Bahari</b> have already been mentioned (<a href =

celebrated temples of this period; the first famous for its rich
clustered lotus-columns, the latter for its beautiful sanctuary
chambers, dedicated each to a different deity, and covered with delicate
painted reliefs of the time of Seti&nbsp;I.</p>

FIG. 13.&mdash;GREAT TEMPLE OF IPSAMBOUL.</p>

<p><b>GROTTO TEMPLES.</b> Two other styles of temple remain to be
noticed. The first is the subterranean or grotto temple, of which the
two most famous, at Ipsamboul (Abou-simbel), were excavated by Rameses
II. They are truly colossal conceptions, reproducing in the native rock
the main features of structural temples, the court being represented by
the larger of two chambers in the Greater Temple (Fig. 13)
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
<a name = "page22" id = "page22"> </a>
Their façades are adorned with colossal seated figures of the builder;
the smaller has also two effigies of Nefert-Ari, his consort. Nothing
more striking and boldly impressive is to be met with in Egypt than
these singular rock-cut façades. Other rock-cut temples of more modest
dimensions are at Addeh, Feraig, Beni-Hassan (the “Speos Artemidos”),
Beit-el-Wali, and Silsileh. At Gherf-Hossein, Asseboua, and Derri are
temples partly excavated and partly structural.</p>


<p><b>PERIPTERAL TEMPLES.</b> The last type of temple to be noticed is
represented by only three or four structures of moderate size; it is the
<i>peripteral</i>, in which a small chamber is surrounded by columns,
usually mounted on a terrace with vertical walls. They were mere
chapels, but are among the most graceful of existing ruins. At Philæ are
two structures, one by Nectanebo, the other Ptolemaic, resembling
peripteral temples, but without cella-chambers or roofs. They may have
been waiting-courts for the adjoining temples. That at Elephantine
(Amenophis III.) has square piers at the sides, and columns only at the
ends. Another by Thothmes II., at Medinet Abou, formed only a part (the
sekos?) of a larger plan. At Edfou is another, belonging to the
Ptolemaic period.</p>


<p><b>LATER TEMPLES.</b> After the architectural inaction of the
Decadence came a marvellous recrudescence of splendor under the
Ptolemies, whose Hellenic origin and sympathies did not lead them into
the mistaken effort to impose Greek models upon Egyptian art. The
temples erected under their dominion, and later under Roman rule, vied
with the grandest works of the Ramessidæ, and surpassed them in the rich
elaboration and variety of their architectural details. The temple at
Edfou (Figs. <a href = "#fig9">9</a>, <a href = "#fig10">10</a>, 14) is
the most perfectly preserved, and conforms most closely to the typical
plan; that of Isis, at Philæ, is the most elaborate and ornate. Denderah
also possesses a group of admirably
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
<a name = "page23" id = "page23"> </a>
preserved temples of the same period. At Esneh, and at Kalabshé and
Kardassy or Ghertashi in Nubia are others.<!-- invisible . --> In all
these one notes innovations of detail and a striving for effect quite
different from the simpler majesty of the preceding age (Fig. 14). One
peculiar feature is the use of screen walls built into the front rows of
columns of the hypostyle hall. Light was admitted above these walls,
which measured about half the height of the columns and were interrupted
at the centre by a curious doorway cut through their whole height and
without any lintel. Long disused types of capital were revived and
others greatly elaborated; and the wall-reliefs were arranged in bands
and panels with a regularity and symmetry rather Greek than
Egyptian.</p>

<p><b>ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS.</b> With the exception of a few purely
utilitarian vaulted structures, all Egyptian architecture was based on
the principle of the lintel. Artistic splendor depended upon the use of
painted and carved pictures, and the decorative treatment of the very
simple supports
<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
<a name = "page24" id = "page24"> </a>
employed. Piers and columns sustained the roofs of such chambers as were
too wide for single lintels, and produced, in halls like those of
Karnak, of the Ramesseum, or of Denderah, a&nbsp;stupendous effect by
their height, massiveness, number, and colored decoration. The simplest
piers were plain square shafts; others, more elaborate, had lotus stalks
and flowers or heads of Hathor carved upon them. The most striking were
those against whose front faces were carved colossal figures of Osiris,
as at Luxor, Medmet Abou, and Karnak (Fig. 15). The columns, which were
seldom over six diameters in height, were treated with greater variety;
the shafts, slightly tapering upward, were either round or clustered in
section, and usually contracted at the base. The capitals with which
they were crowned were usually of one of the five chief types described
below. Besides round and clustered shafts, the Middle Empire and a few
of the earlier monuments of the New Empire employed polygonal or
slightly fluted shafts (see <a href = "#page11">p.&nbsp;11</a>), as at
Beni Hassan and Karnak; these had a plain square abacus, with sometimes
a cushion-like echinus beneath it. A&nbsp;round plinth served as a base
for most of the columns.</p>

<p><b>CAPITALS.</b> The five chief types of capital were:
<i>a</i>,&nbsp;the plain lotus bud, as at Karnak (Great Hall);
<i>b</i>,&nbsp;the clustered lotus bud (Beni-Hassan, Karnak, Luxor,
Gournah, etc.); <i>c</i>,&nbsp;the <i>campaniform</i> or inverted bell
(central aisles at Karnak, Luxor, the Ramesseum); <i>d</i>,&nbsp;the
palm-capital, frequent in the later temples; and <i>e</i>,&nbsp;the
Hathor-headed, in which heads of Hathor adorn the four faces of a
cubical mass surmounted by a model of a shrine (Sedinga, Edfou,
Denderah,
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
<a name = "page25" id = "page25"> </a>
Esneh). These types were richly embellished and varied by the Ptolemaic
architects, who gave a clustered or quatrefoil plan to the bell-capital,
or adorned its surface with palm leaves. A&nbsp;few other forms are met
with as exceptions. The first four are shown in Fig.&nbsp;16.</p>

<p>Every part of the column was richly decorated in color. Lotus-leaves
or petals swathed the swelling lower part of the shaft, which was
elsewhere covered with successive bands of carved pictures and of
hieroglyphics. The capital was similarly covered with carved and painted
ornament, usually of lotus-flowers or leaves, or alternate stalks of
lotus and papyrus.</p>

<span class = "caption">
<i>a, Campaniform; b, Clustered Lotus-Column;<br>
c, Simple Lotus-Column; d, Palm-Column.</i></span></p>

<p>The lintels were plain and square in section, and often of prodigious
size. Where they appeared externally they were crowned with a simple
cavetto cornice, its curved surface covered with colored flutings
alternating with <i>cartouches</i> of hieroglyphics. Sometimes,
especially on the screen walls of the Ptolemaic age, this was surmounted
by a cresting of adders or uræi in closely serried rank. No other form
of cornice or cresting is met with. Mouldings as a means of
architectural effect were singularly lacking in Egyptian architecture.
The only moulding known is the clustered torus (<i>torus</i> = a convex
moulding of semicircular profile), which resembles a bundle of reeds
tied together with cords or ribbons. It forms an astragal under the
cavetto cornice and runs down the angles of the pylons and walls.</p>

<p><b>POLYCHROMY AND ORNAMENT.</b> Color was absolutely
<span class = "pagenum">26</span>
<a name = "page26" id = "page26"> </a>
essential to the decorative scheme. In the vast and dim interiors, as
well as in the blinding glare of the sun, mere sculpture or relief would
have been wasted. The application of brilliant color to pictorial forms
cut in low relief, or outlined by deep incision with the edges of the
figures delicately rounded (<i>intaglio rilievo</i>) was the most
appropriate treatment possible. The walls and columns were covered with
pictures treated in this way, and the ceilings and lintels were
embellished with symbolic forms in the same manner. All the ornaments,
as distinguished from the paintings, were symbolical, at least in their
origin. Over the gateway was the solar disk or globe with wide-spread
wings, the symbol of the sun winging its way to the conquest of night;
upon the ceiling were sacred vultures, zodiacs, or stars spangled on a
blue ground. Externally the temples presented only masses of unbroken
wall; but these, as well as the pylons, were covered with huge pictures
of a historical character. Only in the tombs do we find painted ornament
of a purely conventional sort (Fig. 17). Rosettes, diaper patterns,
spirals, and checkers are to be met with in them; but many of these can
be traced to symbolic origins.<a class = "tag" name = "tag3" id = "tag3"

<p><b>DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE.</b> The only remains of palaces are the
pavilion of Rameses III. at Medinet Abou, and another at Semneh. The
Royal Labyrinth has so completely perished that even its site is
uncertain. The Egyptians lived so much out of doors that the house was a
less important edifice than in colder climates. Egyptian dwellings were
probably in most cases built of wood or crude
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
<a name = "page27" id = "page27"> </a>
brick, and their disappearance is thus easily explained. Relief pictures
on the monuments indicate the use of wooden framing for the walls, which
were probably filled in with crude brick or panels of wood. The
architecture was extremely simple. Gateways like those of the temples on
a smaller scale, the cavetto cornice on the walls, and here and there a
porch with carved columns of wood or stone, were the only details
pretending to elegance. The ground-plans of many houses in ruined
cities, as at Tel-el-Amarna and a nameless city of Amenophis IV., are
discernible in the ruins; but the superstructures are wholly wanting. It
was in religious and sepulchral architecture that the constructive and
artistic genius of the Egyptians was most fully manifested.</p>

<p><b>SITUATION; HISTORIC PERIODS.</b> The Tigro-Euphrates valley was
the seat of a civilization nearly or quite as old as that of the Nile,
though inferior in its monumental art. The kingdoms of Chaldæa and
Assyria which ruled in this valley, sometimes as rivals and sometimes as
subjects one of the other, differed considerably in character and
culture. But the scarcity of timber and the lack of good building-stone
except in the limestone table-lands and more distant mountains of upper
Mesopotamia, the abundance of clay, and the flatness of the country,
imposed upon the builders of both nations similar restrictions of
conception, form, and material. Both peoples, moreover, were probably,
in part at least, of Semitic race.<a class = "tag" name = "tag4" id =
"tag4" href = "#note4">4</a> The Chaldæans attained civilization as
early as 4000 <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>, and had for

<p><b>GENERAL CHARACTER OF MONUMENTS.</b> Recent excavations at Nippur
(Niffer), the sacred city of Chaldæa, have uncovered ruins older than
the Pyramids. Though of slight importance architecturally, they reveal
the early knowledge of the arch and the possession of an advanced
culture. The poverty of the building materials of this region afforded
only the most limited resources for architectural effect. Owing to the
flatness of the country and the impracticability of building lofty
structures with sun-dried bricks, elevation above the plain could be
secured only by erecting buildings of moderate height upon enormous
mounds or terraces, built of crude brick and faced with hard brick or
stone. This led to the development of the stepped pyramid as the typical
form of Chaldæo-Assyrian architecture. Thick walls were necessary both
for stability and for protection from the burning heat of that climate.
The lack of stone for columns and the difficulty of procuring heavy
beams for long spans made broad halls and chambers impossible. The plans
of Assyrian palaces look like assemblages of long corridors and small
cells (Fig. 18). Neither the wooden post nor the column played any part
in this architecture except for window-mullions and subordinate
members.<a class = "tag" name = "tag5" id = "tag5" href =
"#note5">5</a><!-- invisible . --> It is probable that the vault was
used for roofing many of the halls; the arch was certainly employed for
doors and the barrel-vault for the drainage-tunnels
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
<a name = "page30" id = "page30"> </a>
under the terraces, made necessary by the heavy rainfall. What these
structures lacked in durability and height was made up in decorative
magnificence. The interior walls were wainscoted to a height of eight or
nine feet with alabaster slabs covered with those low-relief pictures of
hunting scenes, battles, and gods, which now enrich the museums of
London, Paris, and other modern cities. Elsewhere painted plaster or
more durable enamelled tile in brilliant colors embellished the walls,
and, doubtless, rugs and tapestries added their richness to this
architectural splendor.</p>

FIG. 18.&mdash;PALACE OF SARGON AT KHORSABAD.</p>


<p><b>CHALDÆAN ARCHITECTURE.</b> The ruins at Mugheir (the Biblical Ur),
dating, perhaps, from 2200 <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>,
belong to the two-storied terrace or platform of a temple to Sin or
Hurki.
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
<a name = "page31" id = "page31"> </a>
The wall of sun-dried brick is faced with enamelled tile. The shrine,
which was probably small, has wholly disappeared from the summit of the
mound. At Warka (the ancient Erech) are two terrace-walls of palaces,
one of which is ornamented with convex flutings and with a species of
mosaic in checker patterns and zigzags, formed by terra-cotta cones or
spikes driven into the clay, their exposed bases being enamelled in the
desired colors. The other shows a system of long, narrow panels, in a
style suggesting the influence of Egyptian models through some as yet
unknown channel. This panelling became a common feature of the later
Assyrian art (see Fig. 19). At Birs-Nimroud are the ruins of a stepped
pyramid surmounted by a small shrine. Its seven stages are said to have
been originally faced with glazed tile of the seven planetary colors,
gold, silver, yellow, red, blue, white, and black. The ruins at Nippur,
which comprise temples, altars, and dwellings dating from 4000 <span
class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>, have been alluded to. Babylon, the
later capital of Chaldæa, to which the shapeless mounds of Mujehbeh and
Kasr seem to have belonged, has left no other recognizable vestige of
its ancient magnificence.</p>


<p><b>ASSYRIAN ARCHITECTURE.</b> Abundant ruins exist of Nineveh, the
Assyrian capital, and its adjacent palace-sites. Excavations at
Koyunjik, Khorsabad, and Nimroud have laid bare a number of these royal
dwellings. Among them are the palace of Assur-nazir-pal (885 <span class
= "smallroman">B.C.</span>) and two palaces of Shalmaneser II.<!--
invisible . --> (850 <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span><!-- missing
second . -->) at Nimroud; the great palace of Sargon at Khorsabad (721
<span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span><!-- invisible first . -->); that
of Sennacherib at Koyunjik (704 <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>);
of Esarhaddon at Nimroud (650 <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>);
and of Assur-bani-pal at Koyunjik (660 <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span>). All of these palaces are designed on the same
general principle, best shown by the plan (Fig. 18) of the palace of
Sargon at Khorsabad, excavated by Botta and Place.</p>

<p>In this palace two large and several smaller courts are surrounded by
a complex series of long, narrow halls and
<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
<a name = "page32" id = "page32"> </a>
small, square chambers. One court probably belonged to the harem,
another to the king’s apartments, others to dependents and to the
service of the palace. The crude brick walls are immensely thick and
without windows, the only openings being for doors. The absence of
columns made wide halls impossible, and great size could only be
attained in the direction of length. A&nbsp;terraced pyramid supported
an altar or shrine to the southwest of the palace; at the west corner
was a temple, the substructure of which was crowned by a cavetto cornice
showing plainly the influence of Egyptian models. The whole palace stood
upon a stupendous platform faced with cut stone, an unaccustomed
extravagance in Assyria.</p>

FIG. 19.&mdash;GATE, KHORSABAD.</p>

<p><b>ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS.</b> There is no evidence that the Assyrians
ever used columnar supports except in minor or accessory details. There
are few halls in any of the ruins too wide to be spanned by good Syrian
cedar beams or palm timbers, and these few cases seem to have had
vaulted ceilings. So clumsy a feature as the central wall in the great
hall of Esarhaddon’s palace at Nimroud would never have been resorted to
for the support of the ceiling, had
<span class = "pagenum">33</span>
<a name = "page33" id = "page33"> </a>
the Assyrians been familiar with the use of columns. That they
understood the arch and vault is proved by their admirable
terrace-drains and the fine arched gate in the walls of Khorsabad (Fig.
19), as well as by bas-reliefs representing dwellings with domes of
various forms. Moreover, a&nbsp;few vaulted chambers of moderate size,
and fallen fragments of crude brick vaulting of larger span, have been
found in several of the Assyrian ruins.</p>

<p>The construction was extremely simple. The heavy clay walls were
faced with alabaster, burned brick, or enamelled tiles. The roofs were
probably covered with stamped earth, and sometimes paved on top with
tiles or slabs of alabaster to form terraces. Light was introduced most
probably through windows immediately under the roof and divided by small
columns forming mullions, as suggested by certain relief pictures. No
other system seems consistent with the windowless walls of the ruins. It
is possible that many rooms depended wholly on artificial light or on
the scant rays coming through open doors. To this day, in the hot season
the population of Mosul takes refuge from the torrid heats of summer in
windowless basements lighted only by lamps.</p>


<p><b>ORNAMENT.</b> The only structural decorations seem to have been
the panelling of exterior walls in a manner resembling the Chaldæan
terrace-walls, and a form of parapet like a stepped cresting. There were
no characteristic mouldings, architraves, capitals, or cornices. Nearly
all the ornament was of the sort called <i>applied</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
added after the completion of the structure itself. Pictures in low
relief covered the alabaster revetment. They depicted hunting-scenes,
battles, deities, and other mythological subjects, and are interesting
to the architect mainly for their occasional representations of
buildings and details of construction. Above this wainscot were friezes
of enamelled brick ornamented with symbolic forms used as decorative
<span class = "pagenum">34</span>
<a name = "page34" id = "page34"> </a>
motives; winged bulls, the “sacred tree” and mythological monsters, with
rosettes, palmettes, lotus-flowers, and <i>guilloches</i> (ornaments of
interlacing bands winding about regularly spaced buttons or eyes). These
ornaments were also used on the archivolts around the great arches of
palace gates. The most singular adornments of these gates were the
carved “portal guardians” set into the deep jambs&mdash;colossal
monsters with the bodies of bulls, the wings of eagles, and human heads
of terrible countenance. Of mighty bulk, they were yet minutely wrought
in every detail of head-dress, beard, feathers, curly hair, and
anatomy.</p>

FIG. 20.&mdash;ASSYRIAN ORNAMENT.</p>

<p>The purely conventional ornaments mentioned above&mdash;the rosette,
guilloche, and lotus-flower, and probably also the palmette, were
derived from Egyptian originals. They were treated, however, in a quite
new spirit and adapted to the special materials and uses of their
environment. Thus the form of the palmette, even if derived, as is not
unlikely, from the Egyptian lotus-motive, was assimilated to the more
familiar palm-forms of Assyria (Fig. 20).</p>

<p>Assyrian architecture never rivalled the Egyptian in grandeur or
constructive power, in seriousness, or the higher artistic qualities. It
did, however, produce imposing results with the poorest resources, and
in its use of the arch and its development of ornamental forms it
furnished prototypes for some of the most characteristic features of
later Asiatic art, which profoundly influenced both Greek and Byzantine
architecture.</p>

Mesopotamia, and rivalling the marvels in the Nile Valley. The
conquering nation of warriors who had overthrown the Egyptians and
Assyrians was in turn conquered by the arts of its vanquished foes, and
speedily became the most luxurious of all nations. The Persians were not
great innovators in art; but inhabiting a land of excellent building
resources, they were able to combine the Egyptian system of interior
columns with details borrowed from Assyrian art, and suggestions,
derived most probably from the general use in Persia and Central Asia,
of wooden posts or columns as intermediate supports. Out of these
elements they evolved an architecture which
<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
<a name = "page36" id = "page36"> </a>
has only become fully known to us since the excavations of M. and Mme.
Dieulafoy at Susa in 1882.</p>


<p><b>ELEMENTS OF PERSIAN ARCHITECTURE.</b> The Persians used both crude
and baked bricks, the latter far more freely than was practicable in
Assyria, owing to the greater abundance of fuel. Walls when built of the
weaker material were faced with baked brick enamelled in brilliant
colors, or both moulded and enamelled, to form colored pictures in
relief. Stone was employed for walls and columns, and, in conjunction
with brick, for the jambs and lintels of doors and windows. Architraves
and ceiling-beams were of wood. The palaces were erected, as in Assyria,
upon broad platforms, partly cut in the rock and partly structural,
approached by imposing flights of steps. These palaces were composed of
detached buildings, propylæa or gates of honor, vast audience-halls open
on one or two sides, and chambers or dwellings partly enclosing or
flanking these halls, or grouped in separate buildings. Temples appear
to have been of small importance, perhaps owing to habits of out-of-door
worship of fire and sun. There are few structural tombs, but there are a
number of imposing royal sepulchres cut in the rock at
Naksh-i-Roustam.</p>


<p><b>ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS.</b> The Persians, like the Egyptians, used
the column as an internal feature in hypostyle halls of great size, and
externally to form porches, and perhaps, also, open kiosks without
walls. The great <b>Hall of Xerxes</b> at Persepolis covers 100,000
square feet&mdash;more than double the area of the Hypostyle Hall at
Karnak. But the Persian column was derived from wooden prototypes and
used with wooden architraves, permitting a wider spacing than is
possible with stone. In the present instance thirty-six columns sufficed
for an area which in the Karnak hall contained one hundred and
thirty-four. The shafts being slender and finely fluted instead of
painted or carved, the effect produced was totally different from that
<span class = "pagenum">37</span>
<a name = "page37" id = "page37"> </a>
sought by the Egyptians. The most striking peculiarity of the column was
the capital, which was forked (Fig. 21).<!-- invisible . --> In one of
the two principal types the fork, formed by the coupled fore-parts of
bulls or symbolic monsters, rested directly on the top of the shaft. In
the other, two singular members were interposed between the fork and the
shaft; the lower, a&nbsp;sort of double bell or bell-and-palm capital,
and above it, just beneath the fork, a&nbsp;curious combination of
vertical scrolls or volutes, resembling certain ornaments seen in
Assyrian furniture. The transverse architrave rested in the fork; the
longitudinal architrave was supported on the heads of the monsters.
A&nbsp;rich moulded base, rather high and in some cases adorned with
carved leaves or flutings, supported the columns, which in the Hall of
Xerxes were over 66 feet high and 6 feet in diameter. The architraves
have perished, but the rock-cut tomb of Darius at Naksh-i-Roustam
reproduces in its façade a palace-front, showing a banded architrave
with dentils&mdash;an obvious imitation of the ends of wooden rafters on
a lintel built up of several beams.</p>

FIG. 21.&mdash;COLUMN FROM PERSEPOLIS.</p>

<p>These features of the architrave, as well as the fine flutings and
moulded bases of the columns, are found in Ionic architecture, and in
part, at least, in Lycian tombs. As all these examples date from nearly
the same period, the origin of these forms and their mutual relations
have not been fully determined. The Persian capitals, however, are
<span class = "pagenum">38</span>
<a name = "page38" id = "page38"> </a>
unique, and so far as known, without direct prototypes or derivatives.
Their constituent elements may have been borrowed from various sources.
One can hardly help seeing the Egyptian palm-capital in the lower member
of the compound type (Fig. 21).</p>

<p>The doors and windows had banded architraves or trims and cavetto
cornices very Egyptian in character. The portals were flanked, as in
Assyria, by winged monsters; but these were built up in several courses
of stone, not carved from single blocks like their prototypes. Plaster
or, as at Susa, enamelled bricks, replaced as a wall-finish the Assyrian
alabaster wainscot. These bricks, splendid in color, and moulded into
relief pictures covering large surfaces, are the oldest examples of the
skill of the Persians in a branch of ceramic art in which they have
always excelled down to our own day.</p>


<p><b>LYCIAN ARCHITECTURE.</b> The architecture of those Asiatic peoples
which served as intermediaries between the ancient civilizations of
Egypt and Assyria on the one hand and of the Greeks on the other, need
occupy us only a moment in passing. None of them developed a complete
and independent style or produced monuments of the first rank. Those
chiefly concerned in the transmission of ideas were the Cypriotes,
Phœnicians, and Lycians. The part played by other Asiatic nations is too
slight to be considered here. From Cyprus the Greeks could have learned
little beyond a few elementary notions regarding sculpture and pottery,
although it is possible that the volute-form in Ionic architecture was
originally derived from patterns on Cypriote pottery and from certain
Cypriote steles, where it appears as a modified lotus motive. The
Phœnicians were the world’s traders from a very early age down to the
Persian conquest. They not only distributed through the Mediterranean
lands the manufactures of Egypt and Assyria, but also counterfeited them
and adopted their forms in decorating
<span class = "pagenum">39</span>
<a name = "page39" id = "page39"> </a>
their own wares. But they have bequeathed us not a single architectural
ruin of importance, either of temples or palaces, nor are the few tombs
still extant of sufficient artistic interest to deserve even brief
mention in a work of this scope.</p>

<p>In Lycia, however, there arose a system of tomb-design which came
near creating a new architectural style, and which doubtless influenced
both Persia and the Ionian colonies. The tombs were mostly cut in the
rock, though a few are free-standing monolithic monuments, resembling
sarcophagi or small shrines mounted on a high base or pedestal.</p>

<p>In all of these tombs we recognize a manifest copying in stone of
framed wooden structures. The walls are panelled, or imitate open
structures framed of squared timbers. The roofs are often gabled,
sometimes in the form of a pointed arch; they generally show a banded
architrave, dentils, and a raking cornice, or else an imitation of
broadly projecting eaves with small round rafters. There are several
with porches of Ionic columns; of these, some are of late date and
evidently copied from Asiatic Greek models. Others, and notably one at
Telmissus, seem to be examples of a primitive Ionic, and may indeed have
been early steps in the development of that splendid style which the
Ionic Greeks, both in Asia Minor and in Attica, carried to such
perfection.</p>


<p><b>JEWISH ARCHITECTURE.</b> The Hebrews borrowed from the art of
every people with whom they had relations, so that we encounter in the
few extant remains of their architecture Egyptian, Assyrian, Phœnician,
Greek, Roman, and Syro-Byzantine features, but nothing like an
independent national style. Among the most interesting of these remains
are tombs of various periods, principally occurring in the valleys near
Jerusalem, and erroneously ascribed by popular tradition to the judges,
prophets, and kings of
<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
<a name = "page40" id = "page40"> </a>
Israel. Some of them are structural, some cut in the rock; the former
(tomb of Absalom, of Zechariah) decorated with Doric and Ionic engaged
orders, were once supposed to be primitive types of these orders and of
great antiquity. They are now recognized to be debased imitations of
late Greek work of the third or second century <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span> They have Egyptian cavetto cornices and
pyramidal roofs, like many Asiatic tombs. The openings of the rock-cut
tombs have frames or pediments carved with rich surface ornament showing
a similar mixture of types&mdash;Roman triglyphs and garlands,
Syrian-Greek acanthus leaves, conventional foliage of Byzantine
character, and naturalistic carvings of grapes and local plant-life. The
carved arches of two of the ancient city gates (one the so-called Golden
Gate) in Jerusalem display rich acanthus foliage somewhat like that of
the tombs, but more vigorous and artistic. If of the time of Herod or
even of Constantine, as claimed by some, they would indicate that Greek
artists in Syria created the prototypes of Byzantine ornament. They are
more probably, however, Byzantine restorations of the 6th
century&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span></p>

<p>The one great achievement of Jewish architecture was the national
<b>Temple of Jehovah</b>, represented by three successive edifices on
Mount Moriah, the site of the present so-called “Mosque of Omar.” The
first, built by Solomon (1012 <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>)
appears from the Biblical description<a class = "tag" name = "tag6" id =
"tag6" href = "#note6">6</a> to have combined Egyptian conceptions
(successive courts, lofty entrance-pylons, the Sanctuary and the sekos
or “Holy of Holies”) with Phœnician and Assyrian details and workmanship
(cedar woodwork, empaistic decoration or overlaying with <i>repoussé</i>
metal work, the isolated brazen columns Jachin and Boaz). The whole
stood on a mighty platform built up with stupendous masonry and vaulted
chambers from the valley surrounding the rock on three
<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
<a name = "page41" id = "page41"> </a>
sides. This precinct was nearly doubled in size by Herod (18 <span class
= "smallroman">B.C.</span>) who extended it southward by a terrace-wall
of still more colossal masonry. Some of the stones are twenty-two feet
long; one reaches the prodigious length of forty feet. The “Wall of
Lamentations” is a part of this terrace, upon which stood the Temple on
a raised platform. As rebuilt by Herod, the Temple reproduced in part
the antique design, and retained the porch of Solomon along the east
side; but the whole was superbly reconstructed in white marble with
abundance of gilding. Defended by the Castle of Antonia on the
northwest, and embellished with a new and imposing triple colonnade on
the south, the whole edifice, a&nbsp;conglomerate of Egyptian, Assyrian,
and Roman conceptions and forms, was one of the most singular and yet
magnificent creations of ancient art.</p>

<p>The temple of Zerubbabel (515 <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span>), intermediate between those above described,
was probably less a re-edification of the first, than a new design.
While based on the scheme of the first temple, it appears to have
followed more closely the pattern described in the vision of Ezekiel
(chapters xl.-xlii.). It was far inferior to its predecessor in splendor
and costliness. No vestiges of it remain.</p>


<div class = "monuments">
<p><b>MONUMENTS.</b> <span class = "smallcaps">Persian</span>: at
Murghab, the tomb of Cyrus, known as

<p><b>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.</b> Greek art marks the beginning of
European civilization. The Hellenic race gathered up influences and
suggestions from both Asia and Africa and fused them with others, whose
sources are unknown, into an art intensely national and original, which
was to influence the arts of many races and nations long centuries after
the decay of the Hellenic states. The Greek mind, compared with the
Egyptian or Assyrian, was more highly intellectual, more logical, more
symmetrical, and above all more inquiring and analytic. Living nowhere
remote from the sea, the Greeks became sailors, merchants, and
colonizers. The Ionian kinsmen of the European Greeks, speaking a
dialect of the same language, populated the coasts of Asia Minor and
many of the islands, so that through them the
<span class = "pagenum">44</span>
<a name = "page44" id = "page44"> </a>
Greeks were open to the influences of the Assyrian, Phœnician, Persian,
and Lycian civilizations. In Cyprus they encountered Egyptian
influences, and finally, under Psammetichus, they established in Egypt
itself the Greek city of Naukratis. They were thus by geographical
situation, by character, and by circumstances, peculiarly fitted to
receive, develop, and transmit the mingled influences of the East and
the South.</p>

<p><b>PREHISTORIC MONUMENTS.</b><a class = "tag" name = "tag7" id =
"tag7" href = "#note7">7</a> Authentic Greek history begins with the
first Olympiad, 776 <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span> The earliest
monuments of that historic architecture which developed into the
masterpieces of the Periclean and Alexandrian ages, date from the middle
of the following century. But there are a number of older buildings,
belonging presumably to the so-called Heroic Age, which, though
seemingly unconnected with the later historic development of Greek
architecture, are still worthy of note. They are the work of a people
somewhat advanced in civilization, probably the Pelasgi, who preceded
the Dorians on Greek soil, and consist mainly of fortifications, walls,
gates, and tombs, the most important of which are at <b>Mycenæ</b> and
<b>Tiryns</b>. At the latter place is a well-defined acropolis, with
massive walls in which are passages covered by stones successively
overhanging or corbelled until they meet. The masonry is of huge stones
piled without cement. At Mycenæ the city wall is pierced by the
remarkable <b>Lion Gate</b> (Fig. 22), consisting of two jambs and a
huge lintel,
<span class = "pagenum">45</span>
<a name = "page45" id = "page45"> </a>
over which the weight is relieved by a triangular opening. This is
filled with a sculptured group, now much defaced, representing two
rampant lions flanking a singular column which tapers downward. This
symbolic group has relations with Hittite and Phrygian sculptures, and
with the symbolism of the worship of Rhea Cybele. The masonry of the
wall is carefully dressed but not regularly coursed. Other primitive
walls and gates showing openings and embryonic arches of various forms,
are found widely scattered, at Samos and Delos, at Phigaleia, Thoricus,
Argos and many other points.

FIG. 23.&mdash;POLYGONAL MASONRY.</span>
The very earliest are hardly more than random piles of rough stone.
Those which may fairly claim notice for their artistic masonry are of a
later date and of two kinds: the coursed, and the polygonal or
Cyclopean, so called from the tradition that they were built by the
Cyclopes. These Cyclopean walls were composed of large, irregular
polygonal blocks carefully fitted together and dressed to a fairly
smooth face (Fig. 23). Both kinds were used contemporaneously, though in
the course of time the regular coursed masonry finally superseded the
polygonal.</p>

<p><b>THOLOS OF ATREUS.</b> All these structures present, however, only
the rudiments of architectural art. The so-called <b>Tholos</b> (or
Treasury) of <b>Atreus</b>, at Mycenæ, on the other hand, shows the
germs of truly artistic design (Fig. 24). It is in reality a tomb, and
is one of a large class of prehistoric tombs found in almost every part
of the globe, consisting of a circular stone-walled and stone-roofed
chamber buried under a tumulus of earth. This one is a beehive-shaped
construction of horizontal courses of masonry, with a stone-walled
passage, the <i>dromos</i>, leading to the entrance door.

Though internally of domical form, its construction with horizontal beds
in the masonry proves that the idea of the true dome with the beds of
each course pitched at an angle always normal to the curve of the vault,
was not yet grasped. A&nbsp;small sepulchral chamber opens from the
great one, by a door with the customary relieving triangle
over&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Traces of a metal lining have been found on the inner surface of the
dome and on the jambs of the entrance door. This entrance is the most
artistic and elaborate part of the edifice (Fig. 25). The main opening
is enclosed in a three-banded frame, and was once flanked by columns
which, as shown by fragments still existing and by marks on either side
the door, tapered downward as in the sculptured column over the Lion
Gate. Shafts, bases, and capitals were covered with zig-zag bands or
chevrons of fine spirals. This well-studied decoration, the banded
jambs, and the curiously inverted columns (of which several other
examples exist in or near Mycenæ), all point to a fairly developed art,
derived partly from Egyptian and partly from Asiatic sources. That
Egyptian influences had affected this early art is further
<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
<a name = "page47" id = "page47"> </a>
proved by a fragment of carved and painted ornament on a ceiling in
Orchomenos, imitating with remarkable closeness certain ceiling
decorations in Egyptian tombs.</p>


<p><b>HISTORIC MONUMENTS; THE ORDERS.</b> It was the Dorians and Ionians
who developed the architecture of classic Greece. This fact is
perpetuated in the traditional names, Doric and Ionic, given to the two
systems of columnar design which formed the most striking feature of
that architecture. While in Egypt the column was used almost exclusively
as an internal support and decoration, in Greece it was chiefly employed
to produce an imposing exterior effect. It was the most important
element in the temple architecture of the Greeks, and an almost
indispensable adornment of their gateways, public squares, and temple
enclosures. To the column the two races named above gave each a special
and radically distinct development, and it was not until the Periclean
age that the two forms came to be used in conjunction, even by the mixed
Doric-Ionic people of Attica. Each of the two types had its own special
shaft, capital, entablature, mouldings, and ornaments, although
considerable variation was allowed in the proportions and minor details.
The general type, however, remained substantially unchanged from first
to last. The earliest examples known to us of either order show it
complete in all its parts, its later development being restricted to the
refining and perfecting of its proportions and details. The probable
origin of these orders will be separately considered later&nbsp;on.</p>

<p><b>THE DORIC.</b> The column of the Doric order (Figs. 26, 27)
consists of a tapering shaft rising directly from the stylobate or
platform and surmounted by a capital of great simplicity and beauty. The
shaft is fluted with sixteen to twenty shallow channellings of segmental
or elliptical section, meeting in sharp edges or <i>arrises</i>. The
capital is made up of a circular cushion or <i>echinus</i> adorned with
fine
<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
<a name = "page48" id = "page48"> </a>
grooves called <i>annulæ</i>, and a plain square <i>abacus</i> or cap
Upon this rests a plain architrave or <i>epistyle</i>, with a narrow
fillet, the <i>tænia</i>, running along its upper edge. The frieze above
it is divided into square panels, called the <i>metopes</i>, separated
by vertical <i>triglyphs</i> having each two vertical grooves and
chamfered edges. There is a triglyph over each column and one over each
intercolumniation, or two in rare instances where the columns are widely
spaced. The cornice consists of a broadly projecting <i>corona</i>
resting on a <i>bed-mould</i> of one or two simple mouldings. Its under
surface, called the <i>soffit</i>, is adorned with <i>mutules</i>,
square, flat projections having each eighteen <i>guttæ</i> depending
from its under side. Two or three small mouldings run along the upper
edge of the corona, which has in addition, over each slope of the gable,
a&nbsp;gutter-moulding or <i>cymatium</i>. The cornices along the
horizontal edges of the roof have instead of the cymatium a row of
<i>antefixæ</i>, ornaments of terra-cotta or marble placed opposite the
foot of each tile-ridge of the roofing. The enclosed triangular field of
the gable, called the <i>tympanum</i>, was in the larger monuments
adorned with sculptured groups resting on the shelf formed by the
horizontal cornice below. Carved ornaments called <i>acroteria</i>
commonly embellished the three angles of the gable or pediment.</p>


<p><b>POLYCHROMY.</b> It has been fully proved, after a century of
debate, that all this elaborate system of parts, severe
<span class = "pagenum">49</span>
<a name = "page49" id = "page49"> </a>
and dignified in their simplicity of form, received a rich decoration of
color. While the precise shades and tones employed cannot be predicated
with certainty, it is well established that the triglyphs were painted
blue and the metopes red, and that all the mouldings were decorated with
leaf-ornaments, “eggs-and-darts,” and frets, in red, green, blue, and
gold. The walls and columns were also colored, probably with pale tints
of yellow or buff, to reduce the glare of the fresh marble or the
whiteness of the fine stucco with which the surfaces of masonry of
coarser stone were primed. In the clear Greek atmosphere and outlined
against the brilliant sky, the Greek temple must have presented an
aspect of rich, sparkling gayety.</p>

FIG. 27.&mdash;DORIC ORDER OF THE PARTHENON.</p>

<p><b>ORIGIN OF THE ORDER.</b> It is generally believed that the details
of the Doric frieze and cornice were reminiscences of a primitive wood
construction. The triglyph suggests the chamfered ends of cross-beams
made up of three planks each; the mutules, the sheathing of the eaves;
and the guttæ, the heads of the spikes or trenails by which the
sheathing was secured. It is known that in early astylar temples the
metopes were left open like the spaces between the ends of
ceiling-rafters. In the earlier peripteral temples, as at Selinus, the
triglyph-frieze is retained around the cella-wall under the ceiling of
the colonnade, where it has no functional significance, as a survival
from times antedating the adoption of the colonnade, when
<span class = "pagenum">50</span>
<a name = "page50" id = "page50"> </a>
the tradition of a wooden roof-construction showing externally had not
yet been forgotten.</p>

<p>A similar wooden origin for the Doric column has been advocated by
some, who point to the assertion of Pausanias that in the Doric Heraion
at Olympia the original wooden columns had with one exception been
replaced by stone columns as fast as they decayed. (See <a href =
"#page62">p.&nbsp;62</a>.) This, however, only proves that wooden
columns were sometimes used in early buildings, not that the Doric
column was derived from them. Others would derive it from the Egyptian
columns of Beni Hassan (<a href = "#page12">p.&nbsp;12</a>), which it
certainly resembles. But they do not explain how the Greeks could have
been familiar with the Beni Hassan column long before the opening of
Egypt to them under Psammetichus; nor why, granting them some knowledge
of Egyptian architecture, they should have passed over the splendors of
Karnak and Luxor to copy these inconspicuous tombs perched high up on
the cliffs of the Nile. It would seem that the Greeks invented this form
independently, developing it in buildings which have perished; unless,
indeed, they brought the idea with them from their primitive Aryan home
in Asia.</p>


<p><b>THE IONIC ORDER</b> was characterized by greater slenderness of
proportion and elegance of detail than the Doric, and depended more on
carving than on color for the decoration of its members (Fig. 28). It
was adopted in the fifth century <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>
by the people of Attica, and used both for civic and religious
buildings, sometimes alone and sometimes in conjunction with the Doric.
The column was from eight to ten diameters in height, against four and
one-third to seven for the Doric. It stood on a base which was usually
composed of two tori (see <a href = "#page25">p.&nbsp;25</a> for
definition) separated by a <i>scotia</i> (a&nbsp;concave moulding of
semicircular or semi-elliptical profile), and was sometimes provided
also with a square flat base-block, the <i>plinth</i>. There was much
variety in the proportions and details of these mouldings, which were
often
<span class = "pagenum">51</span>
<a name = "page51" id = "page51"> </a>
enriched by flutings or carved guilloches. The tall shaft bore
twenty-four deep narrow flutings separated by narrow fillets. The
capital was the most peculiar feature of the order. It consisted of a
bead or <i>astragal</i> and echinus, over which was a horizontal band
ending on either side in a scroll or volute, the sides of which
presented the aspect shown in Fig. 29. A&nbsp;thin moulded abacus was
interposed between this member and the architrave.</p>

alt = "see caption and text"><br>
FIG. 28.&mdash;GREEK IONIC ORDER. (MILETUS.)</p>

<p>The Ionic capital was marked by two awkward features which all its
richness could not conceal. One was the protrusion of the echinus beyond
the face of the band above it, the other was the disparity between the
side and front views of the capital, especially noticeable at the
corners of a colonnade. To obviate this, various contrivances were
tried, none wholly successful. Ordinarily the two adjacent exterior
sides of the corner capital were treated alike, the scrolls at their
meeting being bent out at an angle of 45°, while the two inner faces
simply intersected, cutting each other in halves.</p>

<p>The entablature comprised an architrave of two or three flat bands
crowned by fine mouldings; an uninterrupted frieze, frequently
sculptured in relief; and a simple cornice of great beauty. In addition
to the ordinary bed-mouldings there was in most examples a row of narrow
blocks or <i>dentils</i> under the corona, which was itself crowned by a
high cymatium of extremely graceful profile, carved with the rich
“honeysuckle” (<i>anthemion</i>) ornament. All the mouldings were carved
with the “egg-and-dart,” heart-leaf and anthemion ornaments, so designed
as to recall by their outline
<span class = "pagenum">52</span>
<a name = "page52" id = "page52"> </a>
the profile of the moulding itself. The details of this order were
treated with much more freedom and variety than those of the Doric. The
pediments of Ionic buildings were rarely or never adorned with groups of
sculpture. The volutes and echinus of the capital, the fluting of the
shaft, the use of a moulded circular base, and in the cornice the high
corona and cymatium, these were constant elements in every Ionic order,
but all other details varied widely in the different examples.</p>

FIG. 29.&mdash;SIDE VIEW OF IONIC CAPITAL.</p>

<p><b>ORIGIN OF THE IONIC ORDER.</b> The origin of the Ionic order has
given rise to almost as much controversy as that of the Doric. Its
different elements were apparently derived from various sources. The
Lycian tombs may have contributed the denticular cornice and perhaps
also the general form of the column and capital. In the Persian
architecture of the sixth century <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span>, the high moulded base, the narrow flutings of
the shaft, the carved bead-moulding and the use of scrolls in the
capital are characteristic features, which may have been borrowed by the
Ionians during the same century, unless, indeed, they were themselves
the work of Ionic or Lycian workmen in Persian employ. The banded
architrave and the use of the volute in the decoration of stele-caps
(from <span class = "greek" title = "stêlê">στηλη</span> = a memorial
stone or column standing isolated and upright), furniture, and minor
structures are common features in Assyrian, Lycian, and other Asiatic
architecture of early date. The volute or scroll itself as an
independent decorative
<span class = "pagenum">53</span>
<a name = "page53" id = "page53"> </a>
motive may have originated in successive variations of Egyptian
lotus-patterns.<a class = "tag" name = "tag8" id = "tag8" href =
"#note8">8</a> But the combination of these diverse elements and their
development into the final form of the order was the work of the Ionian
Greeks, and it was in the Ionian provinces of Asia Minor that the most
splendid examples of its use are to be found (Halicarnassus, Miletus,
Priene, Ephesus), while the most graceful and perfect are those of
Doric-Ionic Attica.</p>

<span class = "caption">
(From the monument of Lysicrates.)</span></p>

<p><b>THE CORINTHIAN ORDER.</b> This was a late outgrowth of the Ionic
rather than a new order, and up to the time of the Roman conquest was
only used for monuments of small size (see <a href =
"#fig38">Fig.&nbsp;38</a>). Its entablature in pure Greek examples was
identical with the Ionic; the shaft and base were only slightly changed
in proportion and detail. The capital, however, was a new departure,
based probably on metallic embellishments of altars, pedestals, etc., of
Ionic style. It consisted in the best examples of a high bell-shaped
core surrounded by one or two rows of acanthus leaves, above which were
pairs of branching scrolls meeting at the corners in spiral volutes.
These served to support the angles of a moulded abacus with concave
sides (Fig. 30). One example, from the Tower of the Winds (the clepsydra
of Andronicus Cyrrhestes) at Athens, has only smooth pointed palm-leaves
and no scrolls above a single row of acanthus leaves. Indeed, the
variety and disparity among the different
<span class = "pagenum">54</span>
<a name = "page54" id = "page54"> </a>
examples prove that we have here only the first steps toward the
evolution of an independent order, which it was reserved for the Romans
to fully develop.</p>


<p><b>GREEK TEMPLES; THE TYPE.</b> With the orders as their chief
decorative element the Greeks built up a splendid architecture of
religious and secular monuments. Their noblest works were temples, which
they designed with the utmost simplicity of general scheme, but carried
out with a mastery of proportion and detail which has never been
surpassed. Of moderate size in most cases, they were intended primarily
to enshrine the simulacrum of the deity, and not, like Christian
churches, to accommodate great throngs of worshippers. Nor were they, on
the other hand, sanctuaries designed, like those of Egypt, to exclude
all but a privileged few from secret rites performed only by the priests
and king. The statue of the deity was enshrined in a chamber, the
<i>naos</i> (see plan, Fig. 31), often of considerable size, and
accessible to the public through a columnar porch the <i>pronaos</i>.
A&nbsp;smaller chamber, the <i>opisthodomus</i>, was sometimes added in
the rear of the main sanctuary, to serve as a treasury or depository for
votive offerings. Together these formed a windowless structure called
the <i>cella</i>, beyond which was the rear porch, the <i>posticum</i>
or <i>epinaos</i>. This whole structure was in the larger temples
surrounded by a colonnade, the <i>peristyle</i>, which formed the most
splendid feature of Greek architecture. The external aisle on either
side of the cella was called the <i>pteroma</i>. A&nbsp;single gabled
roof covered the entire building.</p>

<p>The Greek colonnade was thus an exterior feature, surrounding
<span class = "pagenum">55</span>
<a name = "page55" id = "page55"> </a>
the solid cella-wall instead of being enclosed by it as in Egypt. The
temple was a public, not a royal monument; and its builders aimed, not
as in Egypt at size and overwhelming sombre majesty, but rather at sunny
beauty and the highest perfection of proportion, execution, and detail
(<a href = "#fig34">Fig.&nbsp;34</a>).</p>

<p>There were of course many variations of the general type just
described. Each of these has received a special name, which is given
below with explanations and is illustrated in Fig.&nbsp;31.</p>

<p><i>In antis</i>; with a porch having two or more columns enclosed
between the projecting side-walls of the cella.</p>

<p><i>Prostylar</i> (or prostyle); with a columnar porch in front and no
peristyle.</p>

<p><i>Amphiprostylar</i> (or -style); with columnar porches at both ends
but no peristyle.</p>

<p><i>Peripteral</i>; surrounded by columns.</p>

<p><i>Pseudoperipteral</i>; with false or engaged columns built into the
walls of the cella, leaving no pteroma.</p>

<p><i>Dipteral</i>; with double lateral ranges of columns (see <a href =
"#fig39">Fig.&nbsp;39</a>).</p>

<p><i>Pseudodipteral</i>; with a single row of columns on each side,
whose distance from the wall is equal to two intercolumniations of the
front.</p>

<p><i>Tetrastyle</i>, <i>hexastyle</i>, <i>octastyle</i>,
<i>decastyle</i>, etc.; with four, six, eight, or ten columns in the end
rows.</p>


<p><b>CONSTRUCTION.</b> All the temples known to us are of stone, though
it is evident from allusions in the ancient writers that wood was
sometimes used in early times. (See <a href = "#page62">p.&nbsp;62</a>.)
The finest temples, especially those of Attica, Olympia, and Asia Minor,
were of marble. In Magna Græcia, at Assos, and in other places where
marble was wanting, limestone, sandstone, or lava was employed and
finished with a thin, fine stucco. The roof was almost invariably of
wood and gabled, forming at the ends pediments decorated in most cases
with sculpture. The disappearance of these inflammable
<span class = "pagenum">56</span>
<a name = "page56" id = "page56"> </a>
and perishable roofs has given rise to endless speculations as to the
lighting of the cellas, which in all known ruins, except one at
Agrigentum, are destitute of windows. It has been conjectured that light
was admitted through openings in the roof, and even that the central
part of the cella was wholly open to the sky. Such an arrangement is
termed <i>hypæthral</i>, from an expression used in a description by
Vitruvius;<a class = "tag" name = "tag9" id = "tag9" href =
"#note9">9</a> but this description corresponds to no known structure,
and the weight of opinion now inclines against the use of the hypæthral
opening, except possibly in one or two of the largest temples, in which
a part of the cella in front of the statue may have been thus left open.
But even this partial <i>hypæthros</i> is not substantiated by direct
evidence. It hardly seems probable that the magnificent chryselephantine
statues of such temples were ever thus left exposed to the extremes of
the climate, which are often severe even in Greece. In the model of the
Parthenon designed by Ch. Chipiez for the Metropolitan Museum in New
York, a&nbsp;small clerestory opening through the roof admits a moderate
amount of light to the cella; but this ingenious device rests on no
positive evidence (see <a href = "main.html#frontis">Frontispiece</a>).
It seems on the whole most probable that the cella was lighted entirely
by artificial illumination; but the controversy in its present state is
and must be wholly speculative.</p>

<p>The wooden roof was covered with tiles of terra-cotta or marble. It
was probably ceiled and panelled on the under side, and richly decorated
with color and gold. The pteroma had under the exterior roof a ceiling
of stone or marble, deeply panelled between transverse architraves.</p>

<p>The naos and opisthodomus being in the larger temples too wide to be
spanned by single beams, were furnished with interior columns to afford
intermediate support. To avoid the extremes of too great massiveness and
excessive slenderness in these columns, they were built in two stages,
<span class = "pagenum">57</span>
<a name = "page57" id = "page57"> </a>
and advantage was taken of this arrangement, in some cases, at least, to
introduce lateral galleries into the naos.</p>

FIG. 32.&mdash;CARVED ANTHEMION ORNAMENT. ATHENS.</p>

<p><b>SCULPTURE AND CARVING.</b> All the architectural membering was
treated with the greatest refinement of design and execution, and the
aid of sculpture, both in relief and in the round, was invoked to give
splendor and significance to the monument. The statue of the deity was
the focus of internal interest, while externally, groups of statues
representing the Olympian deities or the mythical exploits of gods,
demigods, and heroes, adorned the gables. Relief carvings in the friezes
and metopes commemorated the favorite national myths. In these
sculptures we have the finest known adaptations of pure
sculpture&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, sculpture treated as such and complete in
itself&mdash;to an architectural framework. The noblest examples of this
decorative sculpture are those of the Parthenon, consisting of figures
in the full round from the pediments, groups in high relief from the
metopes, and the beautiful frieze of the Panathenaic procession from the
cella-wall under the pteroma ceiling. The greater part of these splendid
works are now in the British Museum, whither they were removed by Lord
Elgin in 1801. From Olympia, <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘Aegina’">Ægina</ins>, and
<span class = "pagenum">58</span>
<a name = "page58" id = "page58"> </a>
Phigaleia, other master-works of the same kind have been transferred to
the museums of Europe. In the Doric style there was little carving other
than the sculpture, the ornament being mainly polychromatic. Greek Ionic
and Corinthian monuments, however, as well as minor works such as
steles, altars, etc., were richly adorned with carved mouldings and
friezes, festoons, acroteria, and other embellishments executed with the
chisel. The anthemion ornament, a&nbsp;form related to the Egyptian
lotus and Assyrian palmette, most frequently figures in these. It was
made into designs of wonderful vigor and beauty (Fig. 32).</p>


<p><b>DETAIL AND EXECUTION.</b> In the handling and cutting of stone the
Greeks displayed a surpassing skill and delicacy. While ordinarily they
were content to use stones of moderate size, they never hesitated at any
dimension necessary for proper effect or solid construction. The lower
drums of the Parthenon peristyle are 6&nbsp;feet 6½ inches in diameter,
and 2&nbsp;feet 10 inches high, cut from single blocks of Pentelic
marble. The architraves of the Propylæa at Athens are each made up of
two lintels placed side by side, the longest 17 feet 7&nbsp;inches long,
3&nbsp;feet 10 inches high, and 2&nbsp;feet 4&nbsp;inches thick. In the
colossal temples of Asia Minor, where the taste for the vast and
grandiose was more pronounced, blocks of much greater size were used.
These enormous stones were cut and fitted with the most scrupulous
exactness. The walls of all important structures were built in regular
courses throughout, every stone carefully bedded with extremely close
joints. The masonry was usually laid up without cement and clamped with
metal; there is no filling in with rubble and concrete between mere
facings of cut stone, as in most modern work. When the only available
stone was of coarse texture it was finished with a coating of fine
stucco, in which sharp edges and minute detail could be worked.</p>

<p>The details were, in the best period, executed with the
<span class = "pagenum">59</span>
<a name = "page59" id = "page59"> </a>
most extraordinary refinement and care. The profiles of capitals and
mouldings, the carved ornament, the arrises of the flutings, were cut
with marvellous precision and delicacy. It has been rightly said that
the Greeks “built like Titans and finished like jewellers.” But this
perfect finish was never petty nor wasted on unworthy or vulgar design.
The just relation of scale between the building and all its parts was
admirably maintained; the ornament was distributed with rare judgment,
and the vigor of its design saved it from all appearance of
triviality.</p>

<p>The sensitive taste of the Greeks led them into other refinements
than those of mere mechanical perfection. In the Parthenon especially,
but also in lesser degree in other temples, the seemingly straight lines
of the building were all slightly curved, and the vertical faces
inclined. This was done to correct the monotony and stiffness of
absolutely straight lines and right angles, and certain optical
illusions which their acute observation had detected. The long
horizontal lines of the stylobate and cornice were made convex upward;
a&nbsp;similar convexity in the horizontal corona of the pediment
counteracted the seeming concavity otherwise resulting from its meeting
with the multiplied inclined lines of the raking cornice. The columns
were almost imperceptibly inclined toward the cella, and the corner
intercolumniations made a trifle narrower than the rest; while the
vertical lines of the arrises of the flutings were made convex outward
with a curve of the utmost beauty and delicacy. By these and other like
refinements there was imparted to the monument an elasticity and vigor
of aspect, an elusive and surprising beauty impossible to describe and
not to be explained by the mere composition and general proportions, yet
manifest to every cultivated eye.<a class = "tag" name = "tag10" id =

These refinements, first noticed by Allason in 1814, and later confirmed
by Cockerell and Haller as to the columns, were published to the world
in 1838 by Hoffer, verified by Penrose in 1846, and further developed by
the investigations of Ziller and later observers.</p>

<p>These dates are, of course, somewhat arbitrary; it is impossible to
set exact bounds to style-periods, which must inevitably overlap at
certain points, but the dates, as given above, will assist in
distinguishing the successive phases of the history.</p>

<p><b>ARCHAIC PERIOD.</b> The archaic period is characterized by the
exclusive use of the Doric order, which appears in the earliest
monuments complete in all its parts, but heavy in its proportions and
coarse in its execution. The oldest known temples of this period are the
<b>Apollo Temple</b> at Corinth (650 <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span>?), and the <b>Northern Temple</b> on the
acropolis at <b>Selinus</b> in Sicily (cir. 610&ndash;590 <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span>). They are both of a coarse limestone covered
with stucco. The columns are low and massive (4⅓ to 4⅔ diameters in
height), widely spaced, and
<span class = "pagenum">61</span>
<a name = "page61" id = "page61"> </a>
carry a very high entablature. The triglyphs still appear around the
cella wall under the pteroma ceiling, an illogical detail destined to
disappear in later buildings. Other temples at Selinus date from the
middle or latter part of the sixth century; they have higher columns and
finer profiles than those just mentioned. The great <b>Temple of
Zeus</b> at <b>Selinus</b> was the earliest of five colossal Greek
temples of very nearly identical dimensions; it measured 360 feet by 167
feet in plan, but was never completed. During the second half of the
sixth century important Doric temples were built at Pæstum in South
Italy, and Agrigentum in Sicily; the somewhat primitive temple at Assos
in Asia Minor, with uncouth carvings of centaurs and monsters on its
architrave, belongs to this same period. The <b>Temple of Zeus</b> at
<b>Agrigentum</b> (Fig. 33) is another singular and exceptional design,
and was the second of the five colossal temples mentioned above. The
pteroma was entirely enclosed by walls with engaged columns showing
externally, and was of extraordinary width. The walls of the narrow
cella were interrupted by heavy piers supporting atlantes, or applied
statues under the ceiling. There seem to have been windows between these
figures, but it is not clear whence they borrowed their light, unless it
was admitted by the omission of the metopes between the external
triglyphs.</p>

FIG. 33.&mdash;TEMPLE OF ZEUS. AGRIGENTUM.</p>


<p><b>THE TRANSITION.</b> During the transitional period there was a
marked improvement in the proportions, detail, and workmanship of the
temples. The cella was made broader, the columns more slender, the
entablature lighter. The triglyphs disappeared from the cella wall, and
sculpture of a higher order enhanced the architectural effect. The
profiles
<span class = "pagenum">62</span>
<a name = "page62" id = "page62"> </a>
of the mouldings and especially of the capitals became more subtle and
refined in their curves, while the development of the Ionic order in
important monuments in Asia Minor was preparing the way for the
splendors of the Periclean age. Three temples especially deserve notice:
the <b>Athena Temple</b> on the island of <b>Ægina</b>, the <b>Temple of
Zeus</b> at <b>Olympia</b>, and the so-called
<b>Theseum</b>&mdash;perhaps a temple of Heracles&mdash;in Athens. They
belong to the period 470&ndash;450 <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span>; they are all hexastyle and peripteral, and
without triglyphs on the cella wall. Of the three the second in the list
is interesting as the scene of those rites which preceded and
accompanied the Panhellenic Olympian games, and as the central feature
of the Altis, the most complete temple-group and enclosure among all
Greek remains. It was built of a coarse conglomerate, finished with fine
stucco, and embellished with sculpture by the greatest masters of the
time. The adjacent <b>Heraion</b> (temple of Hera) was a highly
venerated and ancient shrine, originally built with wooden columns
which, according to Pausanias, were replaced one by one, as they
decayed, by stone columns. The truth of this statement is attested by
the discovery of a singular variety of capitals among its ruins,
corresponding to the various periods at which they were added. The
Theseum is the most perfectly preserved of all Greek temples, and in the
refinement of its forms is only surpassed by those of the Periclean
age.</p>

<p><b>THE PERICLEAN AGE.</b> The Persian wars may be taken as the
dividing line between the Transition period and the Periclean age. The
<i>élan</i> of national enthusiasm that followed the expulsion of the
invader, and the glory and wealth which accrued to Athens as the
champion of all Hellas, resulted in a splendid reconstruction of the
Attic monuments as well as a revival of building activity in Asia Minor.
By the wise administration of Pericles and by the genius of Ictinus,
Phidias, and other artists of surpassing
<span class = "pagenum">63</span>
<a name = "page63" id = "page63"> </a>
skill, the Acropolis at Athens was crowned with a group of buildings and
statues absolutely unrivalled. Chief among them was the
<b>Parthenon</b>, the shrine of Athena Parthenos, which the critics of
all schools have agreed in considering the most faultless in design and
execution of all buildings erected by man (Figs. <a href =
"#fig31">31</a>, 34, and <a href =
"main.html#frontis">Frontispiece</a>). It was an octastyle peripteral
temple, with seventeen columns on the side, and measured 220 by 100 feet
on the top of the stylobate. It was the work of Ictinus and Callicrates,
built to enshrine the noble statue of the goddess by Phidias,
a&nbsp;standing chryselephantine figure forty feet high. It was the
masterpiece of Greek architecture not only by reason of its refinements
of detail, but also on account of the beauty of its sculptural
adornments. The frieze about the cella wall under the pteroma ceiling,
representing in low relief

with masterly skill the Panathenaic procession; the sculptured groups in
the metopes, and the superb assemblages of Olympic and symbolic figures
of colossal size in the pediments, added their majesty to the perfection
of the architecture.

Here also the horizontal curvatures and other refinements are found in
their highest development. Northward from it, upon the Acropolis, stood
the <b>Erechtheum</b>, an excellent example of the Attic-Ionic style
(Figs. 35, 36). Its singular irregularities of plan and level, and the
variety of its detail, exhibit in a striking way the Greek indifference
to mere formal symmetry when confronted by practical considerations. The
motive in this case was the desire to include in one design several
existing and venerated shrines to Attic deities and heroes&mdash;Athena
Polias, Poseidon, Pandrosus, Erechtheus, Boutes, etc. Begun by unknown
architects in 479 <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>, and not
completed until 408 <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>, it remains
in its ruin still one of the most interesting and attractive of ancient
buildings. Its two colonnades of differing design, its beautiful north
doorway, and the unique and noble caryatid porch or balcony on the south
side are unsurpassed in delicate beauty combined with vigor of design.<a

<p>In the <b>Propylæa</b> (Fig. 37), the monumental gateway to the
Acropolis, the Doric and Ionic orders appear to have been combined for
the first time (437 to 432 <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>). It
was the master work of Mnesicles. The front and rear façades were Doric
hexastyles; adjoining the front porch were two projecting lateral wings
employing a smaller Doric order. The central passageway led between two
rows of Ionic columns to the rear porch, entered by five doorways and
crowned, like the front, with a pediment. The whole was executed with
the same splendor and perfection as the other buildings of the
Acropolis, and was a worthy gateway to the group of noble monuments
which crowned that citadel of the Attic capital. The two orders were
also combined in the temple of <b>Apollo Epicurius</b> at
<b>Phigalæa</b> (Bassæ). This temple was erected in 430 <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span> by Ictinus, who used the Ionic order internally
to decorate a row of projecting piers instead of free-standing columns
in the naos, in which there was also a single Corinthian column of
rather archaic design, which may have been used as a support for a
statue or votive offering.</p>

<p><b>ALEXANDRIAN AGE.</b> A period of reaction followed the splendid
architectural activity of the Periclean age. A&nbsp;succession of
disastrous wars&mdash;the Sicilian, Peloponnesian, and
Corinthian&mdash;drained the energies and destroyed the peace of
European Greece for seventy-five years, robbing Athens of her supremacy
and inflicting wounds from which she never recovered. In the latter part
of the fourth century, however, the triumph of the Macedonian empire
over all the Mediterranean lands inaugurated a new era of architectural
magnificence, especially in Asia Minor. The keynote of the art of this
time was splendor, as that of the preceding age was artistic perfection.
The Corinthian order came into use, as though the Ionic were not rich
enough for the sumptuous taste of the time, and capitals and bases of
novel and elaborate design embellished the Ionic temples of Asia Minor.
In the temple of <b>Apollo Didymæus</b> at Miletus, the plinths of the
bases were made octagonal and panelled with rich scroll-carvings; and
the piers which buttressed the interior faces of the cella-walls were
given capitals of singular but elegant form, midway between the Ionic
and Corinthian types. This temple belongs to the list of colossal
edifices already referred to; its dimensions were 366 by 163 feet,
making it the largest of them all. The famous <b>Artemisium</b> (temple
of Artemis or Diana) measured 342 by 163 feet. Several of the columns of
the latter were enriched with sculptured figures encircling the lower
drums of the colossal shafts.

<span class = "caption">

The most lavish expenditure was bestowed upon small structures, shrines,
and sarcophagi. The graceful monument still visible in Athens, erected
by the <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘choraegus’">choragus</ins> Lysicrates in token of his victory in the
choral competitions, belongs to this period (330 <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span><!-- invisible second . -->). It is circular,
with a slightly domical imbricated roof, and is decorated with elegant
engaged Corinthian columns (Fig. 38). In the Imperial Museum at
Constantinople are several sarcophagi of this period found at Sidon, but
<span class = "pagenum">67</span>
<a name = "page67" id = "page67"> </a>
executed by Greek artists, and of exceptional beauty. They are in the
form of temples or shrines; the finest of them, supposed by some to have
been made for Alexander’s favorite general Perdiccas, and by others for
the Persian satrap who figures prominently on its sculptured reliefs, is
the most sumptuous work of the kind in existence. The exquisite
polychromy of its beautiful reliefs and the perfection of its rich
details of cornice, pediment, tiling, and crestings, make it an
exceedingly interesting and instructive example of the minor
architecture of the period.</p>


<p><b>THE DECADENCE.</b> After the decline of Alexandrian magnificence
Greek art never recovered its ancient glory, but the flame was not
suddenly extinguished. While in Greece proper the works of the second
and third centuries <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>, are for the
most part weak and lifeless, like the <b>Stoa of Attalus</b> (175 <span
class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>) and the <b>Tower of the Winds</b> (the
Clepsydra of Andronicus Cyrrhestes, 100 <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span>) at Athens or the Portico of Philip in Delos,
there were still a few worthy works built in Asia Minor. The splendid
<b>Altar</b> erected at <b>Pergamon</b> by Eumenes II. (circ. 180 <span
class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>) in the Ionic order, combined sculpture
of extraordinary vigor with imposing architecture in masterly fashion.
At <b>Aizanoi</b> an Ionic <b>Temple to Zeus</b>, by some attributed to
the Roman period, but showing rather the character of good late Greek
work, deserves mention for its elegant details, and especially for its
frieze-decoration of acanthus leaves and scrolls resembling those of a
Corinthian capital.</p>

<p><b>ROMAN PERIOD.</b> During this period, <i>i.e.</i>, throughout the
second and first centuries <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>, the
Roman dominion was spreading over Greek territory, and the structures
erected subsequent to the conquest partake of the Roman character and
mingle Roman conceptions with Greek details and <i>vice versâ</i>. The
temple of the <b>Olympian Zeus</b> at Athens (Fig. 39), a&nbsp;mighty
dipteral Corinthian edifice measuring 354 by 171 feet, standing on a
vast terrace or temenos surrounded by a buttressed wall, was begun by
Antiochus Epiphanes (170 <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>) on the
site of an earlier unfinished Doric temple of the time of Pisistratus,
and carried out under the direction of the Roman architect, Cossutius.
It was not, however, finally completed until the time of Hadrian, 130
<span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> Meanwhile Sulla had despoiled it
of several columns<a class = "tag" name = "tag12" id = "tag12" href =
"#note12">12</a> which he carried to Rome (86 <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span>), to use in the rebuilding of the temple of
Jupiter on the Capitol, where they undoubtedly served as models in the
development of the Roman Corinthian order. The columns were 57 feet
high, with capitals of the most perfect Corinthian type; fifteen are now
standing, and one lies prostrate near by. To the Roman period also
belong the <b>Agora Gate</b> (circ. 35 <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span>), the <b>Arch of Hadrian</b> (117 <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span>), the <b>Odeon of Regilla</b> or of Herodes
Atticus (143 <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>), at Athens, and
many temples and tombs, theatres, arches, etc., in the Greek
provinces.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">69</span>
<a name = "page69" id = "page69"> </a>
<p><b>SECULAR MONUMENTS; PROPYLÆA.</b> The stately gateway by which the
Acropolis was entered has already been described. It was the noblest and
most perfect of a class of buildings whose prototype is found in the
monumental columnar porches of the palace-group at Persepolis. The
Greeks never used the arch in these structures, nor did they attach to
them the same importance as did most of the other nations of antiquity.
The Altis of Olympia, the national shrine of Hellenism, appears to have
had no central gateway of imposing size, but a number of insignificant
entrances disposed at random. The <b>Propylæa</b> of <b>Sunium</b>,
<b>Priene</b> and <b>Eleusis</b> are the most conspicuous, after those
of the Athenian Acropolis. Of these the Ionic gateway at Priene is the
finest, although the later of the two at Eleusis is interesting for its
anta-capitals. (<i>Anta</i> = a flat pilaster decorating the end of a
wing-wall and treated with a base and capital usually differing from
those of the adjacent columns.) These are of Corinthian type, adorned
with winged horses, scrolls, and anthemions of an exuberant richness of
design, characteristic of this late period.</p>


<p><b>COLONNADES, STOÆ.</b> These were built to connect public monuments
(as the Dionysiac theatre and Odeon at Athens); or along the sides of
great public squares, as at Assos and Olympia (the so-called <b>Echo
Hall</b>); or as independent open public halls, as the <b>Stoa Diple</b>
at Thoricus. They afforded shelter from sun and rain, places for
promenading, meetings with friends, public gatherings, and similar
purposes. They were rarely of great size, and most of them are of rather
late date, though the archaic structure at Pæstum, known as the
<b>Basilica</b>, was probably in reality an open hall of this kind.</p>

<p><b>THEATRES, ODEONS.</b> These were invariably cut out of the rocky
hillsides, though in a few cases (Mantinæa, Myra, Antiphellus)
a&nbsp;part of the seats were sustained by a built-up substructure and
walls to eke out the deficiency of the hill-slope
<span class = "pagenum">70</span>
<a name = "page70" id = "page70"> </a>
under them. The front of the excavation was enclosed by a stage and a
set scene or background, built up so as to leave somewhat over a
semicircle for the <i>orchestra</i> or space enclosed by the lower tier
of seats (Fig. 40). An altar to Dionysus (Bacchus) was the essential
feature in the foreground of the orchestra, where the Dionysiac choral
dance was performed. The seats formed successive steps of stone or
marble sweeping around the sloping excavation, with carved marble
thrones for the priests, archons, and other dignitaries. The only
architectural decoration of the theatre was that of the set scene or
<i>skene</i>, which with its wing-walls (<i>paraskenai</i>) enclosing
the stage (<i>logeion</i>) was a permanent structure of stone or marble
adorned with doors, cornices, pilasters, etc. This has perished in
nearly every case; but at Aspendus, in Asia Minor, there is one still
fairly well preserved, with a rich architectural decoration on its inner
face. The extreme diameter of the theatres varied greatly; thus at
Aizanoi it is 187 feet, and at Syracuse 495 feet. The theatre of
Dionysus at Athens (finished 325 <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>)
could accommodate thirty thousand spectators.</p>

<p>The odeon differed from the theatre principally in being smaller and
entirely covered in by a wooden roof. The <b>Odeon of Regilla</b>, built
by Herodes Atticus in Athens (143 <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span>), is a well-preserved specimen of this class,
but all traces of its cedar ceiling and of its intermediate supports
have disappeared.</p>


<p><b>BUILDINGS FOR ATHLETIC CONTESTS.</b> These comprised stadia and
hippodromes for races, and gymnasia and
<span class = "pagenum">71</span>
<a name = "page71" id = "page71"> </a>
palæstræ for individual exercise, bathing, and amusement. The
<i>stadia</i> and <i>hippodromes</i> were oblong enclosures surrounded
by tiers of seats and without conspicuous architectural features. The
<i>palæstra</i> or <i>gymnasium</i>&mdash;for the terms are not clearly
distinguished&mdash;was a combination of courts, chambers, tanks
(<i>piscinæ</i>) for bathers and <i>exedræ</i> or semicircular recesses
provided with tiers of seats for spectators and auditors, destined not
merely for the exercises of athletes preparing for the stadium, but also
for the instruction and diversion of the public by recitations,
lectures, and discussions. It was the prototype of the Roman thermæ, but
less imposing, more simple in plan and adornment. Every Greek city had
one or more of them, but they have almost wholly disappeared, and the
brief description by Vitruvius and scanty remains at Alexandria Troas
and Ephesus furnish almost the only information we possess regarding
their form and arrangement.</p>


<p><b>TOMBS.</b> These are not numerous, and the most important are
found in Asia Minor. The greatest of these is the famed <b>Mausoleum</b>
at Halicarnassus in Caria, the monument erected to the king Mausolus by
his widow Artemisia (354 <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>; Fig.
41). It was designed by Satyrus and Pythius in the Ionic style, and
comprised a podium or base 50 feet high and measuring 80 feet by 100
feet, in which was the sepulchre. Upon this base stood a cella
surrounded by thirty-six Ionic columns; and crowned by a pyramidal roof,
on the peak of which was a colossal marble quadriga at a height of 130
feet. It was superbly decorated by Scopas and other great sculptors with
statues, marble lions, and a magnificent frieze. The British Museum
possesses fragments of this most imposing monument. At Xanthus the
<b>Nereid Monument</b>, so called from its sculptured figures of
Nereides, was a somewhat similar design on a smaller scale, with sixteen
Ionic columns. At Mylassa was another tomb with an open Corinthian
colonnade supporting a roof formed
<span class = "pagenum">72</span>
<a name = "page72" id = "page72"> </a>
in a stepped pyramid. Some of the later rock-cut tombs of Lycia at Myra
and Antiphellus may also be counted as Hellenic works.</p>

<p><b>DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE.</b> This never attained great importance in
Greece, and our knowledge of the typical Greek house is principally
derived from literary sources. Very few remains of Greek houses have
been found sufficiently well preserved to permit of restoring even the
plan. It is probable that they resembled in general arrangement the
houses of Pompeii (see <a href = "#page107">p.&nbsp;107</a>); but that
they were generally insignificant in size and decoration. The exterior
walls were pierced only by the entrance doors, all light being derived
from one or more interior courts. In the Macedonian epoch there must
have been greater display and luxury in domestic architecture, but no
remains have

<p><b>LAND AND PEOPLE.</b> The geographical position of Italy conferred
upon her special and obvious advantages for taking up and carrying
northward and westward the arts of civilization. A&nbsp;scarcity of good
harbors was the only drawback amid the blessings of a glorious climate,
fertile soil, varied scenery, and rich material resources. From a remote
antiquity Dorian colonists had occupied the southern portion and the
island of Sicily, enriching them with splendid monuments of Doric art;
and Phœnician commerce had brought thither the products of Oriental art
and industry. The foundation of Rome in 753 <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span> established the nucleus about which the sundry
populations of Italy were to crystallize into the Roman nation, under
the dominating influence of the Latin element. Later on, the absorption
of the conquered Etruscans added to this composite people a race of
builders and engineers, as yet rude and uncouth in their art, but
destined to become a powerful factor in developing the new architecture
that was to spring from the contact of the practical Romans with the
noble art of the Greek centres.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">75</span>

<p><b>GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS.</b> While the Greeks bequeathed to
posterity the most perfect models of form in literary and plastic art,
it was reserved for the Romans to work out the applications of these to
every-day material life. The Romans were above all things a practical
people. Their consummate skill as organizers is manifest in the
marvellous administrative institutions of their government, under which
they united the most distant and diverse nationalities. Seemingly
deficient in culture, they were yet able to recast the forms of Greek
architecture in new moulds, and to evolve therefrom a mighty
architecture adapted to wholly novel conditions. They brought
engineering into the service of architecture, which they fitted to the
varied requirements of government, public amusement, private luxury, and
the common comfort. They covered the antique world with arches and
amphitheatres, with villas, baths, basilicas, and temples, all bearing
the unmistakable impress of Rome, though wrought by artists and artisans
of divers races. Only an extraordinary genius for organization could
have accomplished such results.</p>

<p>The architects of Rome marvellously extended the range of their art,
and gave it a flexibility by which it accommodated itself to the widest
variety of materials and conditions. They made the arch and vault the
basis of their system of design, employing them on a scale previously
undreamed of, and in combinations of surpassing richness and majesty.
They systematized their methods of construction so that soldiers and
barbarians could execute the rough mass of their buildings, and
formulated the designing of the decorative details so that artisans of
moderate skill could execute them with good effect. They carried the
principle of repetition of motives to its utmost limit, and sought to
counteract any resulting monotony by the scale and splendor of the
design. Above all they developed planning into a fine art, displaying
their genius in a wonderful
<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
<a name = "page76" id = "page76"> </a>
variety of combinations and in an unfailing sense of the demands of
constructive propriety, practical convenience, and artistic effect.
Where Egyptian or Greek architecture shows one type of plan, the Roman
shows a score.</p>


<p><b>GREEK INFLUENCE.</b> Previous to the closing years of the Republic
the Romans had no art but the Etruscan. The few buildings of importance
they possessed were of Etruscan design and workmanship, excepting a
small number built by Greek hands. It was not until the Empire that
Roman architecture took on a truly national form. True Roman
architecture is essentially imperial. The change from the primitive
Etruscan style to the splendors of the imperial age was due to the
conquest of the Greek states. Not only did the Greek campaigns enrich
Rome with an unprecedented wealth of artistic spoils; they also brought
into Italy hosts of Greek artists, and filled the minds of the
campaigners with the ambition to realize in their own dominions the
marble colonnades, the temples, theatres, and propylæa of the Greek
cities they had pillaged. The Greek orders were adopted, altered, and
applied to arcaded designs as well as to peristyles and other open
colonnades. The marriage of the column and arch gave birth to a system
of forms as characteristic of Roman architecture as the Doric or Ionic
colonnade is of the Greek.</p>

FIG. 42.&mdash;ROMAN DORIC ORDER. (THEATRE OF MARCELLUS).</p>

<p><b>THE ROMAN ORDERS.</b> To meet the demands of Roman taste the
Etruscan column was retained with its simple entablature; the Doric and
Ionic were adopted in a modified form; the Corinthian was developed into
a complete and independent order, and the Composite was added to the
list. A&nbsp;regular system of proportions for all these five orders was
gradually evolved, and the mouldings were profiled with arcs of circles
instead of the subtler Greek curves. In the building of many-storied
structures the
<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
<a name = "page77" id = "page77"> </a>
orders were superposed, the more slender over the sturdier, in an
orderly and graded succession. The immense extent and number of the
Roman buildings, the coarse materials often used, the relative scarcity
of highly trained artisans, and above all, the necessity of making a
given amount of artistic design serve for the largest possible amount of
architecture, combined to direct the designing of detail into uniform
channels. Thus in time was established a sort of canon of proportions,
which was reduced to rules by Vitruvius, and revived in much more
detailed and precise form by Vignola in the sixteenth century.</p>

FIG. 43.&mdash;ROMAN IONIC ORDER.</p>

<p>In each of the orders, including the Doric, the column was given a
base one half of a diameter in height (the unit of measurement being the
diameter of the lower part of the shaft, the <i>crassitudo</i> of
Vitruvius). The shaft was made to contract about one-sixth in diameter
toward the capital, under which it was terminated by an <i>astragal</i>
or collar of small mouldings; at the base it ended in a slight flare and
fillet called the <i>cincture</i>. The entablature was in all cases
given not far from one quarter the height of the whole column. The
<b>Tuscan</b> order was a rudimentary or Etruscan Doric with a column
seven diameters high and a simple entablature without triglyphs,
mutules, or dentils. But few examples of its use are known. The
<b>Doric</b> (Fig. 42) retained the triglyphs and metopes, the mutules
and guttæ of the Greek; but the column was made eight diameters high,
<span class = "pagenum">78</span>
<a name = "page78" id = "page78"> </a>
the shaft was smooth or had deep flutings separated by narrow fillets,
and was usually provided with a simple moulded base on a square plinth.
Mutules were used only over the triglyphs, and were even replaced in
some cases by dentils; the corona was made lighter than the Greek, and a
cymatium replaced the antefixæ on the lateral cornices. The Ionic
underwent fewer changes, and these principally in the smaller mouldings
and details of the capital. The column was nine diameters high (Fig.
43). The <b>Corinthian</b> was made into an independent order by the
designing of a special base of small <i>tori</i> and <i>scotiæ</i>, and
by sumptuously carved <i>modillions</i> or brackets enriching the
cornice and supporting the corona above a denticulated bed-mould (Fig.
44). Though the first designers of the modillion were probably Greeks,
it must, nevertheless, be taken as really a Roman device, worthily
completing the essentially Roman Corinthian order. The <b>Composite</b>
was formed by combining into one capital portions of the Ionic and
Corinthian, and giving to it a simplified form of the Corinthian
cornice. The Corinthian order remained, however, the favorite order of
Roman architecture.</p>

FIG. 44.&mdash;CORINTHIAN ORDER (TEMPLE OF CASTOR AND POLLUX).</p>

<p><b>USE OF THE ORDERS.</b> The Romans introduced many innovations in
the general use and treatment of the orders. Monolithic shafts were
preferred to those built up of superposed drums. The fluting was omitted
on these, and when hard and semi-precious stone like porphyry or
verd-antique was the material, it was highly polished to bring out its
color. These polished monoliths were often
<span class = "pagenum">79</span>
<a name = "page79" id = "page79"> </a>
of great size, and they were used in almost incredible numbers.</p>

<p>Another radical departure from Greek usage was the mounting of
columns on pedestals to secure greater height without increasing the
size of the column and its entablature. The Greek <i>anta</i> was
developed into the Roman pilaster or flattened wall-column, and every
free column, or range of columns perpendicular to the façade, had its
corresponding pilaster to support the wall-end of the architrave. But
the most radical innovation was the general use of engaged columns as
wall-decorations or buttresses. The engaged column projected from the
wall by more than half its diameter, and was built up with the wall as a
part of its substance (Fig. 45). The entablature was in many cases
advanced only over the columns, between which it was set back almost to
the plane of the wall. This practice is open to the obvious criticism
that it makes the column appear superfluous by depriving it of its
function of supporting the continuous entablature. The objection has
less weight when the projecting entablature over the column serves as a
pedestal for a statue or
<span class = "pagenum">80</span>
<a name = "page80" id = "page80"> </a>
similar object, which restores to the column its function as a support
(see the Arch of Constantine, <a href = "#fig63">Fig. 63</a>).</p>

FIG. 45.&mdash;ROMAN ARCADE WITH ENGAGED COLUMNS<br>
<span class = "caption">
(From the Colosseum.)</span></p>

<p><b>ARCADES.</b> The orders, though probably at first used only as
free supports in porticos and colonnades, were early applied as
decorations to arcaded structures. This practice became general with the
multiplication of many-storied arcades like those of the amphitheatres,
the engaged columns being set between the arches as buttresses,
supporting entablatures which marked the divisions into stories (Fig.
45). This combination has been assailed as a false and illogical device,
but the criticism proceeds from a too narrow conception of architectural
propriety. It is defensible upon both artistic and logical grounds; for
it not only furnishes a most desirable play of light and shade and a
pleasing contrast of rectangular and curved lines, but by emphasizing
the constructive divisions and elements of the building and the vertical
support of the piers, it also contributes to the expressiveness and
vigor of the design.</p>


<p><b>VAULTING.</b> The Romans substituted vaulting in brick, concrete,
or masonry for wooden ceilings wherever possible, both in public and
private edifices. The Etruscans were
<span class = "pagenum">81</span>
<a name = "page81" id = "page81"> </a>
the first vault-builders, and the Cloaca Maxima, the great sewer of
Republican Rome (about 500 <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>) still
remains as a monument of their engineering skill. Probably not only
Etruscan engineers (whose traditions were perhaps derived from Asiatic
sources in the remote past), but Asiatic builders also from conquered
eastern provinces, were engaged together in the development of the
wonderful system of vaulted construction to which Roman architecture so
largely owed its grandeur. Three types of vault were commonly used: the
barrel-vault, the groined or four-part vault, and the dome.</p>

FIG. 46.&mdash;BARREL VAULT.</p>

<p>The barrel vault (Fig. 46) was generally semi-cylindrical in section,
and was used to cover corridors and oblong halls, like the
temple-cellas, or was bent around a curve, as in amphitheatre
passages.</p>

<p class = "illustration floatleft">

FIG. 47.&mdash;GROINED VAULT.<br>
<span class = "caption">
<i>g, g, Groins.</i></span></p>

<p>The groined vault is formed by the intersection of two barrel-vaults
(Fig. 47). When several compartments of groined vaulting are placed
together over an oblong plan, a&nbsp;double advantage is secured.
Lateral windows can be carried up to the full height of the vaulting
instead of being stopped below its springing; and the weight and thrust
of the vaulting are concentrated upon a number of isolated points
instead of being exerted along the whole extent of the side walls, as
with the barrel-vault. The Romans saw that it was sufficient to dispose
the masonry at these points in masses at right angles to the length of
the hall, to best resist the lateral
<span class = "pagenum">82</span>
<a name = "page82" id = "page82"> </a>
thrust of the vault. This appears clearly in the plan of the Basilica of
Constantine (<a href = "#fig58">Fig.&nbsp;58</a>).</p>

<p>The dome was in almost all Roman examples supported on a circular
wall built up from the ground, as in the Pantheon (<a href =
"#fig54">Fig.&nbsp;54</a>). The pendentive dome, sustained by four or
eight arches over a square or octagonal plan, is not found in true Roman
buildings.</p>

<p>The Romans made of the vault something more than a mere constructive
device. It became in their hands an element of interior effect at least
equally important with the arch and column. No style of architecture has
ever evolved nobler forms of ceiling than the groined vault and the
dome. Moreover, the use of vaulting made possible effects of
unencumbered spaciousness and amplitude which could never be compassed
by any combination of piers and columns. It also assured to the Roman
monuments a duration and a freedom from danger of destruction by fire
impossible with any wooden-roofed architecture, however noble its form
or careful its execution.</p>


<p><b>CONSTRUCTION.</b> The constructive methods of the Romans varied
with the conditions and resources of different provinces, but were
everywhere dominated by the same practical spirit. Their vaulted
architecture demanded for the support of its enormous weights and for
resistance to its disruptive thrusts, piers and buttresses of great
mass. To construct these wholly of cut stone appeared preposterous and
wasteful to the Roman. Italy abounds in clay, lime, and a volcanic
product, <i>pozzolana</i> (from Puteoli or Pozzuoli, where it has always
been obtained in large quantities), which makes an admirable hydraulic
cement. With these materials it was possible to employ unskilled labor
for the great bulk of this massive masonry, and to erect with the
greatest rapidity and in the most economical manner those stupendous
piles which, even in their ruin, excite the admiration of every
beholder.</p>

<p class = "caption w150">
<i>a, Brickwork; b, Tufa ashlar; r, Opus reticulatum; i, Opus
incertum.</i></p>

<p><b>STONE, CONCRETE, AND BRICK MASONRY.</b> For buildings of an
externally decorative character such as temples, arches of triumph, and
amphitheatres, as well as in all places where brick and concrete were
not easily obtained, stone was employed. The walls were built by laying
up the inner and outer faces in <i>ashlar</i> or cut stone, and filling
in the intermediate space with rubble (random masonry of uncut stone)
laid up in cement, or with concrete of broken stone and cement dumped
into the space in successive layers. The cement converted the whole into
a conglomerate closely united with the face-masonry. In Syria and Egypt
the local preference for stones of enormous size was gratified, and even
surpassed, as in Herod’s terrace-walls for the temple at Jerusalem (<a
href = "#page41">p.&nbsp;41</a>), and in the splendid structures of
Palmyra and Baalbec. In Italy, however, stones of moderate size were
preferred, and when blocks of unusual dimensions occur, they are in many
cases marked with false joints, dividing them into apparently smaller
blocks, lest they should dwarf the building by their large scale. The
general use in the Augustan period of marble for a decorative lining or
wainscot in interiors led in time to the objectionable practice of
coating buildings of concrete with an apparel of sham marble masonry, by
carving false joints upon an external veneer of thin slabs of that
material. Ordinary concrete walls were frequently faced with small
blocks of tufa, called, according to the manner of its application,
<i>opus reticulatum</i>, <i>opus incertum</i>, <i>opus spicatum</i>,
etc. (Fig. 48). In most cases, however, the facing was of carefully
executed brickwork, covered sometimes by a coating of stucco. The bricks
were large, measuring from one to two feet square where used for quoins
or arches, but triangular
<span class = "pagenum">84</span>
<a name = "page84" id = "page84"> </a>
where they served only as facings. Bricks were also used in the
construction of skeleton ribs for concrete vaults of large span.</p>


<p><b>VAULTING.</b> Here, as in the wall-masonry, economy and common
sense devised methods extremely simple for accomplishing vast designs.
While the smaller vaults were, so to speak, cast in concrete upon moulds
made of rough boards, the enormous weight of the larger vaults precluded
their being supported, while drying or “setting,” upon timber centrings
built up from the ground. Accordingly, a&nbsp;skeleton of light ribs was
first built on wooden centrings, and these ribs, when firmly “set,”
became themselves supports for intermediate centrings on which to cast
the concrete fillings between the ribs. The whole vault, once hardened,
formed really a monolithic curved lintel, exerting no thrust whatever,
so that the extraordinary precautions against lateral disruption
practised by the Romans were, in fact, in many cases quite
superfluous.</p>


<p><b>DECORATION.</b> The temple of Castor and Pollux in the Forum (long
miscalled the temple of <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘Jupitor’">Jupiter</ins> Stator), is a typical example of Roman
architectural decoration, in which richness was preferred to the subtler
refinements of design (see <a href = "#fig44">Fig.&nbsp;44</a>). The
splendid figure-sculpture which adorned the Greek monuments would have
been inappropriate on the theatres and thermæ of Rome or the provinces,
even had there been the taste or the skill to produce it. Conventional
carved ornament was substituted in its place, and developed into a
splendid system of highly decorative forms. Two principal elements
appear in this decoration&mdash;the acanthus-leaf, as the basis of a
whole series of wonderfully varied motives; and symbolism, represented
principally by what are technically termed
<i>grotesques</i>&mdash;incongruous combinations of natural forms, as
when an infant’s body terminates in a bunch of foliage (Fig. 49). Only
to a limited extent do we find true sculpture employed as
<span class = "pagenum">85</span>
<a name = "page85" id = "page85"> </a>
decoration, and that mainly for triumphal arches or memorial
columns.</p>

<span class = "caption">
(Lateran Museum.)</span></p>

<p>The architectural mouldings were nearly always carved, the Greek
water-leaf and egg-and-dart forming the basis of most of the
enrichments; but these were greatly elaborated and treated with more
minute detail than the Greek prototypes. Friezes and bands were commonly
ornamented with the foliated scroll or <i>rinceau</i> (a&nbsp;convenient
French term for which we have no equivalent). This motive was as
characteristic of Roman art as the anthemion was of the Greek. It
consists of a continuous stem throwing out alternately on either side
branches which curl into spirals and are richly adorned with rosettes,
acanthus-leaves, scrolls, tendrils, and blossoms. In the best examples
the detail was modelled with great care and minuteness, and the motive
itself was treated with extraordinary variety and fertility of
invention. A&nbsp;derived and enriched form of the anthemion was
sometimes used for bands and friezes; and grotesques, dolphins,
griffins, infant genii, wreaths,
<span class = "pagenum">86</span>
<a name = "page86" id = "page86"> </a>
festoons, ribbons, eagles, and masks are also common features in Roman
relief carving.</p>

FIG. 50.&mdash;ROMAN CEILING PANELS.<br>
<span class = "caption">
(<i>a</i>, From Palmyra; <i>b</i>, Basilica of Constantine.)</span></p>

<p>The Romans made great use of panelling and of moulded plaster in
their interior decoration, especially for ceilings. The panelling of
domes and vaults was usually roughly shaped in their first construction
and finished afterward in stucco with rich moulding and rosettes. The
panels were not always square or rectangular, as in Greek ceilings, but
of various geometric forms in pleasing combinations (Fig. 50). In works
of a small scale the panels and decorations were wrought in relief in a
heavy coating of plaster applied to the finished structure, and these
stucco reliefs are among the most refined and charming products of Roman
art. (Baths of Titus; Baths at Pompeii; Palace of the Cæsars and tombs
at Rome.)</p>


<p><b>COLOR DECORATION.</b> Plaster was also used as a ground for
painting, executed in distemper or by the encaustic process, wax
liquefied by a hot iron being the medium for applying the color in the
latter case. Pompeii and Herculaneum furnish countless examples of
brilliant wall-painting in which strong primary colors form the ground,
and a semi-naturalistic, semi-fantastic representation of figures,
architecture and landscape is mingled with festoons, vines, and purely
conventional ornament. Mosaic was also employed to decorate floors and
wall-spaces, and sometimes for ceilings.<a class = "tag" name = "tag13"
id = "tag13" href = "#note13">13</a> The later imperial baths and
palaces were especially
<span class = "pagenum">87</span>
<a name = "page87" id = "page87"> </a>
rich in mosaic of the kind called opus Grecanicum, executed with
numberless minute cubes of stone or glass, as in the Baths of Caracalla
and the Villa of Hadrian at Tivoli.</p>

<p>To the walls of monumental interiors, such as temples, basilicas, and
thermæ, splendor of color was given by veneering them with thin slabs of
rare and richly colored marble. No limit seems to have been placed upon
the costliness or amount of these precious materials. Byzantine
architecture borrowed from this practice its system of interior color
decoration.</p>

<p><b>THE ETRUSCAN STYLE.</b> Although the first Greek architects were
employed in Rome as early as 493 <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>,
the architecture of the Republic was practically Etruscan until nearly
100 <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span> Its monuments, consisting
mainly of city walls, tombs, and temples, are all marked by a general
uncouthness of detail, denoting a lack of artistic refinement, but they
display considerable constructive skill. In the Etruscan walls we meet
with both polygonal and regularly coursed masonry; in both kinds the
true arch appears as the almost universal form for gates and openings.
A&nbsp;famous example is the Augustan Gate at Perugia, a&nbsp;late work
rebuilt about 40 <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>, but thoroughly
Etruscan in style. At Volaterræ (Volterra) is another arched gate, and
in Perugia fragments of still another appear built into the modern
walls.</p>

<p>The Etruscans built both structural and excavated tombs; they
consisted in general of a single chamber with a slightly arched or
gabled roof, supported in the larger tombs on heavy square piers. The
interiors were covered with pictures; externally there was little
ornament except about the gable and doorway. The latter
<span class = "pagenum">89</span>
<a name = "page89" id = "page89"> </a>
had a stepped or moulded frame with curious <i>crossettes</i> or ears
projecting laterally at the top. The gable recalled the wooden roofs of
Etruscan temples, but was coarse in detail, especially in its mouldings.
Sepulchral monuments of other types are also met with, such as
<i>cippi</i> or memorial pillars, sometimes in groups of five on a
single pedestal (tomb at Albano).</p>

<p>Among the temples of Etruscan style that of <b>Jupiter
Capitolinus</b> on the Capitol at Rome, destroyed by fire in 80 <span
class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>, was the chief. Three narrow chambers
side by side formed a cella nearly square in plan, preceded by a
hexastyle porch of huge Doric, or rather Tuscan, columns arranged in
three aisles, widely spaced and carrying ponderous wooden architraves.
The roof was of wood; the cymatium and ornaments, as well as the statues
in the pediment, were of terra-cotta, painted and gilded. The details in
general showed acquaintance with Greek models, which appeared in debased
and awkward imitations of triglyphs, cornices, antefixæ, etc.</p>

steadily increased the vogue of Greek architecture and the number of
Greek artists in Rome. The temples of the last two centuries <span class
= "smallroman">B.C.</span>, and some of earlier date, though still
Etruscan in plan, were in many cases strongly Greek in the character of
their details. A&nbsp;few have remained to our time in tolerable
preservation. The temple of <b>Fortuna
<span class = "pagenum">90</span>
<a name = "page90" id = "page90"> </a>
Virilis</b> (really of Fors Fortuna), of the second century (?) <span

pseudoperipteral temple with a high <i>podium</i> or base,
a&nbsp;typical Etruscan cella, and a deep porch, now walled up, but
thoroughly Greek in the elegant details of its Ionic order (Fig. 51).
Two circular temples, both called erroneously <b>Temples of Vesta</b>,
one at Rome near the Cloaca Maxima, the other at Tivoli, belong among
the monuments of Greek style. The first was probably dedicated to
Hercules, the second probably to the Sibyls; the latter being much the
better preserved of the two. Both were surrounded by peristyles of
eighteen Corinthian columns, and probably covered by domical roofs with
gilded bronze tiles. The Corinthian order appears here complete with its
modillion cornice, but the crispness of the detail and the fineness of
the execution are Greek and not Roman. These temples date from about 72
<span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>, though the one at Rome was

<p><b>IMPERIAL ARCHITECTURE; AUGUSTAN AGE.</b> Even in the temples of
Greek style Roman conceptions of plan and composition are dominant. The
Greek architect was not free to reproduce textually Greek designs or
details, however strongly he might impress with the Greek character
whatever he touched. The demands of imperial splendor
<span class = "pagenum">91</span>
<a name = "page91" id = "page91"> </a>
and the building of great edifices of varied form and complex structure,
like the thermæ and amphitheatres, called for new adaptations and
combinations of planning and engineering. The reign of Augustus (27
<span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>-14 <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span>) inaugurated the imperial epoch, but many works
erected before and after his reign properly belong to the Augustan age
by right of style. In general, we find in the works of this period the
happiest combination of Greek refinement with Roman splendor. It was in
this period that Rome first assumed the aspect of an opulent and
splendid metropolis, though the way had been prepared for this by the
regularization and adornment of the Roman Forum and the erection of many
temples, basilicas, fora, arches, and theatres during the generation
preceding the accession of Augustus. His reign saw the inception or
completion of the portico of Octavia, the Augustan forum, the Septa
Julia, the first Pantheon, the adjoining Thermæ of Agrippa, the theatre
of Marcellus, the first of the imperial palaces on the Palatine, and a
long list of temples, including those of the Dioscuri (Castor and
Pollux), of Mars Ultor, of Jupiter Tonans on the Capitol, and others in
the provinces; besides colonnades, statues, arches, and other
embellishments almost without number.</p>


<p><b>LATER IMPERIAL WORKS.</b> With the successors of Augustus splendor
increased to almost fabulous limits, as, for instance, in the vast
extent and the prodigality of ivory and gold in the famous Golden House
of Nero. After the great fire in Rome, presumably kindled by the agents
of this emperor, a&nbsp;more regular and monumental system of
street-planning and building was introduced, and the first municipal
building-law was decreed by him. To the reign of Vespasian (68&ndash;79
<span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>) we owe the rebuilding in Roman
style and with the Corinthian order of the temple of Jupiter
Capitolinus, the Baths of Titus, and the beginning of the Flavian
amphitheatre or Colosseum. The two last-named
<span class = "pagenum">92</span>
<a name = "page92" id = "page92"> </a>
edifices both stood on the site of Nero’s Golden House, of which the
greater part was demolished to make way for them. During the last years
of the first century the arch of Titus was erected, the Colosseum
finished, amphitheatres built at Verona, Pola, Reggio, Tusculum, Nîmes
(France), Constantine (Algiers), Pompeii and Herculanum (these last two
cities and Stabiæ rebuilt after the earthquake of 63 <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span>), and arches, bridges, and temples erected all
over the Roman world.</p>

<p>The first part of the second century was distinguished by the
splendid architectural achievements of the reign of Hadrian
(117&ndash;138 <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>) in Rome and the
provinces, especially Athens. Nearly all his works were marked by great
dignity of conception as well as beauty of detail. During the latter
part of the century a very interesting series of buildings were erected
in the Hauran (Syria), in which Greek and Arab workmen under Roman
direction produced examples of vigorous stone architecture of a mingled
Roman and Syrian character.</p>

<p>The most-remarkable thermæ of Rome belong to the third
century&mdash;those of Caracalla (211&ndash;217 <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span>) and of Diocletian (284&ndash;305 <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span>)&mdash;their ruins to-day ranking among the
most imposing remains of antiquity. In Syria the temples of the Sun at
Baalbec and Palmyra (273 <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>, under
Aurelian), and the great palace of Diocletian at Spalato, in Dalmatia
(300 <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>), are still the wonder of
the few travellers who reach those distant spots.</p>

<p>While during the third and fourth centuries there was a marked
decline in purity and refinement of detail, many of the later works of
the period display a remarkable freedom and originality in conception.
But these works are really not Roman, they are foreign, that is,
provincial products; and the transfer of the capital to Byzantium
revealed the increasing degree in which Rome was coming to look to the
East for her strength and her art.</p>

FIG. 53.&mdash;TEMPLE OF VENUS AND ROME. PLAN.</p>

<p><b>TEMPLES.</b> The Romans built both rectangular and circular
temples, and there was much variety in their treatment. In the
rectangular temples a high <i>podium</i>, or basement, was substituted
for the Greek stepped stylobate, and the prostyle plan was more common
than the peripteral. The cella was relatively short and wide, the front
porch inordinately deep, and frequently divided by longitudinal rows of
columns into three aisles. In most cases the exterior of the cella in
prostyle temples was decorated by engaged columns. A&nbsp;barrel vault
gave the interior an aspect of spaciousness impossible with the Greek
system of a wooden ceiling supported on double ranges of columns. In the
place of these, free or engaged columns along the side-walls received
the ribs of the vaulting. Between these ribs the ceiling was richly
panelled, or coffered and sumptuously gilded. The temples of <b>Fortuna
Virilis</b> and of <b>Faustina</b> at Rome (the latter built 141 <span
class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>, and its ruins incorporated into the
modern church of S.&nbsp;Lorenzo in Miranda), and the beautiful and
admirably preserved <b>Maison
<span class = "pagenum">94</span>
<a name = "page94" id = "page94"> </a>
Carrée</b>, at Nîmes (France) (4&nbsp;<span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span>) are examples of this type. The temple of
<b>Concord</b>, of which only the podium remains, and the small temple
of Julius (both of these in the Forum) illustrate another form of
prostyle temple in which the porch was on a long side of the cella. Some
of the larger temples were peripteral. The temple of the <b>Dioscuri</b>
(Castor and Pollux) in the Forum, was one of the most magnificent of
these, certainly the richest in detail (<a href =
"#fig44">Fig.&nbsp;44</a>). Very remarkable was the double temple of
<b>Venus and Rome</b>, east of the Forum, designed by the Emperor
Hadrian about 130 <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> (Fig. 53). It
was a vast pseudodipteral edifice containing two cellas in one
structure, their statue-niches or apses meeting back to back in the
centre. The temple stood in the midst of an imposing columnar peribolus
entered by magnificent gateways. Other important temples have already
been mentioned on <a href = "#page91">p.&nbsp;91</a>.</p>

<p>Besides the two circular temples already described, the temple of
Vesta, adjoining the House of the Vestals, at the east end of the Forum
should be mentioned. At Baalbec is a circular temple whose entablature
curves inward between the widely-spaced columns until it touches the
cella in the middle of each intercolumniation. It illustrates the
caprices of design which sometimes resulted from the disregard of
tradition and the striving after originality (273 <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span>).</p>

FIG. 54.&mdash;PLAN OF THE PANTHEON.</p>

<p><b>THE PANTHEON.</b> The noblest of all circular temples of Rome and
of the world was the <b>Pantheon</b>. It was built by Hadrian,
117&ndash;138 <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>, on the site of the
earlier rectangular temple of the same name erected by Agrippa. It
measures 142 feet in diameter
<span class = "pagenum">95</span>
<a name = "page95" id = "page95"> </a>
internally; the wall is 20 feet thick and supports a hemispherical dome
rising to a height of 140 feet (Figs. 54, 55). Light is admitted solely
through a round opening 28 feet in diameter at the top of the dome, the
simplest and most impressive method of illumination conceivable.
The rain and snow that enter produce no appreciable effect upon the
temperature of the vast hall. There is a single entrance, with noble
bronze doors, admitting directly to the interior, around which seven
niches, alternately rectangular and semicircular in plan and fronted by
Corinthian columns, lighten, without weakening, the mass of the
encircling wall. This wall was originally incrusted with rich marbles,
and the great dome, adorned with deep coffering in rectangular panels,
was decorated with rosettes and mouldings in gilt stucco. The dome
appears to have been composed of numerous arches and ribs, filled in and
finally coated with concrete. A&nbsp;recent examination of a denuded
portion of its inner surface has convinced the writer that the interior
panelling was executed after, and not during, its construction, by
hewing the panels out of the mass of brick and concrete, without regard
to the form and position of the origin skeleton of ribs.</p>

The gabled porch of twelve superb granite columns 50 feet high,
three-aisled in plan after the Etruscan mode, and covered originally by
a ceiling of bronze, was a rebuilding with the materials and on the plan
of the original pronaos of the Pantheon of Agrippa. The circular wall
behind it is faced with fine brickwork, and displays, like the dome,
many curious arrangements of discharging arches, reminiscences of
traditional constructive precautions here wholly useless and fictitious
because only skin-deep. A&nbsp;revetment of marble below and plaster
above once concealed this brick facing. The portico, in spite of its too
steep gable (once filled with a “gigantomachia” in gilt bronze) and its
somewhat awkward association with a round building, is nevertheless a
noble work, its capitals in Pentelic marble ranking among the finest
known examples of the Roman Corinthian. Taken as a whole, the Pantheon
is one of the great masterpieces of the world’s architecture.</p>

<p><b>FORA AND BASILICAS.</b> The fora were the places for general
public assemblage. The chief of those in Rome, the <b>Forum Magnum</b>,
or <b>Forum Romanum</b>, was at first merely an irregular vacant space,
about and in which, as the focus of the civic life, temples, halls,
colonnades, and statues gradually accumulated. These chance aggregations
the systematic Roman mind reduced in time to orderly and monumental
form; successive emperors extended them and added new fora at enormous
cost and with great splendor of architecture. Those of Julius, Augustus,
Vespasian, and Nerva (or Domitian), adjoining the Roman Forum, were
magnificent enclosures surrounded by high walls and single or double
colonnades. Each contained a temple or basilica, besides gateways,
memorial columns or arches, and countless statues. The <b>Forum of
Trajan</b> surpassed all the rest; it covered an area of thirty-five
thousand square yards, and included, besides the main area, entered
through a triumphal arch, the Basilica Ulpia, the temple of Trajan, and
his colossal Doric column of Victory. Both in size and beauty it ranked
as the chief architectural glory of the city (Fig. 57). The six fora
together contained thirteen temples, three basilicas, eight triumphal
arches, a&nbsp;mile of porticos, and a number of other public
edifices.<a class = "tag" name = "tag14" id = "tag14" href =

FIG. 58.&mdash;BASILICA OF CONSTANTINE. PLAN.</p>

<p>The public business of Rome, both judicial and commercial, was
largely transacted in the <i>basilicas</i>, large buildings consisting
usually of a wide and lofty central nave flanked by lower side-aisles,
and terminating at one or both ends in an apse or semicircular recess
called the <i>tribune</i>, in which were the seats for the magistrates.
The side-aisles were separated from the nave by columns supporting a
clearstory wall, pierced by windows above the roofs of the side-aisles.
In some cases the latter were two stories high, with galleries; in
others the central space was open to the sky, as at Pompeii, suggesting
the derivation of the basilica from the open square surrounded by
colonnades, or from the forum itself, with which we find it usually
associated. The most important basilicas in Rome were the
<b>Sempronian</b>, the <b>Æmilian</b> (about 54 <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span>), the <b>Julian</b> in the Forum Magnum (51
<span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>), and the <b>Ulpian</b> in the
Forum of Trajan (113 <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>). The last
two were probably open basilicas, only the side-aisles being roofed. The
Ulpian (Fig. 57) was the most magnificent of all, and in conjunction
with the Forum of Trajan formed one of the most imposing of those
monumental aggregations of columnar architecture which contributed so
largely to the splendor of the Roman capital.</p>

<p>These monuments frequently suffered from the burning of their wooden
roofs. It was Constantine who completed the first vaulted and fireproof
basilica, begun by his predecessor and rival, Maxentius, on the site of
the former Temple of Peace (Figs. 58, 59). Its design reproduced on a
<span class = "pagenum">99</span>
<a name = "page99" id = "page99"> </a>
grand scale the plan of the tepidarium-halls of the thermæ, the
side-recesses of which were converted into a continuous side-aisle by
piercing arches through the buttress-walls that separated them. Above
the imposing vaults of these recesses and under the cross-vaults of the
nave were windows admitting abundant light. A&nbsp;<i>narthex</i>, or
porch, preceded the hall at one end; there were also a side entrance
from the Via Sacra, and an apse or tribune for the magistrates opposite
each of these entrances. The dimensions of the main hall (325 × 85
feet), the height of its vault (117 feet), and the splendor of its
columns and incrustations excited universal admiration, and exercised a
powerful influence on later architecture.</p>

<p><b>THERMÆ.</b> The leisure of the Roman people was largely spent in
the great baths, or <i>thermæ</i>, which took the place substantially of
the modern club. The establishments
<span class = "pagenum">100</span>
<a name = "page100" id = "page100"> </a>
erected by the emperors for this purpose were vast and complex congeries
of large and small halls, courts, and chambers, combined with a masterly
comprehension of artistic propriety and effect in the sequence of
oblong, square, oval, and circular apartments, and in the relation of
the greater to the lesser masses. They were a combination of the Greek
<i>palæstra</i> with the Roman <i>balnea</i>, and united in one
harmonious design great public swimming-baths, private baths for
individuals and families, places for gymnastic exercises and games,
courts, peristyles, gardens, halls for literary entertainments,
lounging-rooms, and all the complex accommodation required for the
service of the whole establishment. They were built with apparent
disregard of cost, and adorned with splendid extravagance. The earliest
were the <b>Baths of Agrippa</b> (27 <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span>) behind the Pantheon; next may be mentioned
those of <b>Titus</b>, built on the substructions of Nero’s Golden
House. The remains of the <b>Thermæ of Caracalla</b> (211 <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span>) form the most extensive mass of ruins in Rome,
and clearly display the admirable planning of this and similar
establishments. A&nbsp;gigantic block of buildings containing the three
great halls for cold, warm, and hot baths, stood in the centre of a vast
enclosure surrounded by private baths, <i>exedræ</i>, and halls for
lecture-audiences and other gatherings. The enclosure was adorned with
statues, flower-gardens, and places for out-door games. The <b>Baths of
Diocletian</b> (302 <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>) embodied
this arrangement
<span class = "pagenum">101</span>
<a name = "page101" id = "page101"> </a>
on a still more extensive scale; they could accommodate 3,500 bathers at
once, and their ruins cover a broad territory near the railway terminus
of the modern city. The church of S.&nbsp;Maria degli Angeli was formed
by Michael Angelo out of the <i>tepidarium</i> of these
baths&mdash;a&nbsp;colossal hall 340 × 87 feet, and 90 feet high. The
original vaulting and columns are still intact, and the whole interior
most imposing, in spite of later stucco disfigurements. The circular
<i>laconicum</i> (sweat-room) serves as the porch to the present church.
It was in the building of these great halls that Roman architecture
reached its most original and characteristic expression. Wholly
unrelated to any foreign model, they represent distinctively Roman
ideals, both as to plan and construction.</p>

FIG. 61.&mdash;ROMAN THEATRE.<!-- invisible . --> (HERCULANUM.)<br>
<span class = "caption">
(From model.)</span></p>


<p><b>PLACES OF AMUSEMENT.</b> The earliest Roman theatres differed from
the Greek in having a nearly semicircular plan, and in being built up
from the level ground, not excavated in a hillside (Fig. 61). The first
theatre was of wood, built by Mummius 145 <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span>, and it was not until ninety years later that
stone was first substituted for the more perishable material, in the
theatre of Pompey. The <b>Theatre of Marcellus</b> (23&ndash;13 <span
class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>) is in part still extant, and later
theatres in Pompeii, Orange (France), and in the Asiatic provinces are
in excellent preservation. The orchestra was not, as in the Greek
theatre, reserved for the choral dance, but was given up to spectators
of rank; the stage was adorned with a permanent architectural background
of columns and
<span class = "pagenum">102</span>
<a name = "page102" id = "page102"> </a>
arches, and sometimes roofed with wood, and an arcade or colonnade
surrounded the upper tier of seats. The amphitheatre was a still more
distinctively Roman edifice. It was elliptical in plan, surrounding an
elliptical arena, and built up with continuous encircling tiers of
seats. The earliest stone amphitheatre was erected by Statilius Taurus
in the time of Augustus. It was practically identical in design with the
later and much larger Flavian amphitheatre, commonly known as the
<b>Colosseum</b>, begun by Vespasian and completed 82 <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> (Fig. 62). This immense structure measured 607
× 506 feet in plan and was 180 feet high; it could accommodate
eighty-seven thousand spectators. Engaged columns of the Tuscan, Ionic,
and Corinthian orders decorated three stories of the exterior; the
fourth was a nearly unbroken wall with slender Corinthian pilasters.
Solidly constructed of travertine, concrete, and tufa, the Colosseum,
with its imposing but monotonous exterior, almost sublime by its scale
and seemingly endless repetition, but lacking in refinement or
originality of detail and dedicated to bloody and cruel sports, was a
characteristic product of the Roman character and civilization. At
Verona, Pola,
<span class = "pagenum">103</span>
<a name = "page103" id = "page103"> </a>
Capua, and many cities in the foreign provinces there are well-preserved
remains of similar structures.</p>

FIG. 62.&mdash;COLOSSEUM. HALF PLAN.</p>

<p>Closely related to the amphitheatre were the circus and the stadium.
The <b>Circus Maximus</b> between the Palatine and Aventine hills was
the oldest of those in Rome. That erected by Caligula and Nero on the
site afterward partly occupied by St. Peter’s, was more splendid, and is
said to have been capable of accommodating over three hundred thousand
spectators after its enlargement in the fourth century. The long, narrow
race-course was divided into two nearly equal parts by a low parapet,
the <i>spina</i>, on which were the goals (<i>metæ</i>) and many small
decorative structures and columns. One end of the circus, as of the
stadium also, was semicircular; the other was segmental in the circus,
square in the stadium; a&nbsp;colonnade or arcade ran along the top of
the building, and the entrances and exits were adorned with monumental
arches.</p>

FIG. 63.&mdash;ARCH OF CONSTANTINE.<br>
<span class = "caption">
(From model in Metropolitan Museum, New York.)</span></p>

<p><b>TRIUMPHAL ARCHES AND COLUMNS.</b> Rome and the provincial cities
abounded in monuments commemorative of victory, usually single or triple
arches with engaged columns and rich sculptural adornments, or single
colossal columns supporting statues. The arches were characteristic
products of Roman design, and some of them deserve high praise for the
excellence of their proportions and the elegance of their details. There
were in Rome in the second century <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span>, thirty-eight of these monuments. The <b>Arch
of Titus</b> (71&ndash;82 <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>) is the
simplest and most perfect of those still extant in Rome; the arch of
<b>Septimius Severus</b> in the Forum (203 <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span>) and that of <b>Constantine</b> (330 <span
class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>) near the Colosseum, are more sumptuous
but less pure in detail. The last-named was in part enriched with
sculptures taken from the earlier arch of Trajan. The statues of Dacian
captives on the attic (<i>attic</i> = a species of subordinate story
added above the main cornice) of this arch were a fortunate addition,
furnishing a <i>raison-d’être</i>
<span class = "pagenum">104</span>
<a name = "page104" id = "page104"> </a>
for the columns and broken entablatures on which they rest. Memorial
columns of colossal size were erected by several emperors, both in Rome
and abroad. Those of <b>Trajan</b> and of <b>Marcus Aurelius</b> are
still standing in Rome in perfect preservation. The first was 140 feet
high including the pedestal and the statue which surmounted it; its
capital marked the height of the ridge levelled by the emperor for the
forum on which the column stands. Its most striking peculiarity is the
spiral band of reliefs winding around the shaft from bottom to top and
representing the Dacian campaigns of Trajan. The other column is of
similar design and dimensions, but greatly inferior to the first in
execution. Both are really towers, with interior stair-cases leading to
the top.</p>


<p><b>TOMBS.</b> The Romans developed no special and national type of
tomb, and few of their sepulchral monuments were of large dimensions.
The most important in Rome were the pyramid of <b>Caius Cestius</b>
(late first century <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>), and the
circular tombs of <b>Cecilia Metella</b> (60 <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span>), <b>Augustus</b> (14 <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span>) and <b>Hadrian</b>, now the Castle of
S.&nbsp;Angelo (138 <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>). The latter
was composed of a huge cone of marble supported on a cylindrical
structure 230 feet in diameter standing on a square podium 300 feet long
and wide. The cone probably once terminated in the gilt bronze pine-cone
now in the Giardino della Pigna of the Vatican. In the Mausoleum of
Augustus a mound of earth planted with trees
<span class = "pagenum">105</span>
<a name = "page105" id = "page105"> </a>
crowned a similar circular base of marble on a podium 220 feet square,
now buried.</p>

<p>The smaller tombs varied greatly in size and form. Some were vaulted
chambers, with graceful internal painted decorations of figures and vine
patterns combined with low-relief enrichments in stucco. Others were
designed in the form of altars or sarcophagi, as at Pompeii; while
others again resembled ædiculæ, little temples, shrines, or small towers
in several stories of arches and columns, as at St. Rémy (France).</p>


<p><b>PALACES AND DWELLINGS.</b> Into their dwellings the Romans carried
all their love of ostentation and personal luxury. They anticipated in
many details the comforts of modern civilization in their furniture,
their plumbing and heating, and their utensils. Their houses may be
divided into four classes: the palace, the villa, the <i>domus</i> or
ordinary house, and the <i>insula</i> or many-storied tenement built in
compact blocks. The first three alone concern us, and will be taken up
in the above order.</p>

<p>The imperial <b>palaces</b> on the Palatine Hill comprised a wide
range in style and variety of buildings, beginning with the first simple
house of Augustus (26 <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>), burnt and
rebuilt 3&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> Tiberius,
Caligula, and Nero added to the Augustan group; Domitian rebuilt a
second time and enlarged the palace of Augustus, and Septimius Severus
remodelled the whole group, adding to it his own extraordinary
seven-storied palace, the Septizonium. The ruins of these successive
buildings have been carefully excavated, and reveal a remarkable
combination of dwelling-rooms, courts, temples, libraries, basilicas,
baths, gardens, peristyles, fountains, terraces, and covered passages.
These were adorned with a profusion of precious marbles, mosaics,
columns, and statues. Parts of the demolished palace of Nero were
incorporated in the substructions of the Baths of Titus. The beautiful
arabesques and plaster reliefs
<span class = "pagenum">106</span>
<a name = "page106" id = "page106"> </a>
which adorned them were the inspiration of much of the fresco and stucco
decoration of the Italian Renaissance. At Spalato, in Dalmatia, are the
extensive ruins of the great <b>Palace of Diocletian</b>, which was laid
out on the plan of a Roman camp, with two intersecting avenues (Fig.
64). It comprised a temple, mausoleum, basilica, and other structures
besides those portions devoted to the purposes of a royal residence.</p>

FIG. 64.&mdash;PALACE OF DIOCLETIAN. SPALATO.</p>

<p>The <b>villa</b> was in reality a country palace, arranged with
special reference to the prevailing winds, exposure to the sun and
shade, and the enjoyment of a wide prospect. Baths, temples,
<i>exedræ</i>, theatres, tennis-courts, sun-rooms, and shaded porticoes
were connected with the house proper, which was built around two or
three interior courts or peristyles. Statues, fountains, and colossal
vases of marble adorned the grounds, which were laid out in terraces and
treated with all the fantastic arts of the Roman landscape-gardener. The
most elaborate and extensive villa was that of <b>Hadrian</b>, at Tibur
(Tivoli); its ruins, covering hundreds of acres, form one of the most
interesting spots to visit in the neighborhood of Rome.</p>

<p>There are few remains in Rome of the <b>domus</b> or private house.
Two, however, have left remarkably interesting ruins&mdash;the <b>Atrium
Vestæ</b>, or House of the Vestal Virgins,
<span class = "pagenum">107</span>
<a name = "page107" id = "page107"> </a>
east of the Forum, a&nbsp;well-planned and extensive house surrounding a
cloister or court; and the <b>House of Livia</b>, so-called, on the
Palatine Hill, the walls and decorations of which are excellently
preserved. The typical Roman house in a provincial town is best
illustrated by the ruins of Pompeii and Herculanum, which, buried by an
eruption of Vesuvius in 79 <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>, have
been partially excavated since 1721. The Pompeiian house (Fig. 65)
consisted of several courts or <i>atria</i>, some of which were
surrounded by colonnades and called <i>peristyles</i>. The front portion
was reserved for shops, or presented to the street a wall unbroken save
by the entrance; all the rooms and chambers opened upon the interior
courts, from which alone they borrowed their light. In the brilliant
climate of southern Italy windows were little needed, as sufficient
light was admitted by the door, closed only by portières for the most
part; especially as the family life was passed mainly in the shaded
courts, to which fountains, parterres of shrubbery, statues, and other
adornments lent their inviting charm. The general plan of these houses
seems to have been of Greek origin, as well as the system of decoration
used on the walls. These, when not wainscoted with
<span class = "pagenum">108</span>
<a name = "page108" id = "page108"> </a>
marble, were covered with fantastic, but often artistic, painted
decorations, in which an imaginary architecture as of metal,
a&nbsp;fantastic and arbitrary perspective, illusory pictures, and
highly finished figures were the chief elements. These were executed in
brilliant colors with excellent effect. The houses were lightly built,
with wooden ceilings and roofs instead of vaulting, and usually with but
one story on account of the danger from earthquakes. That the
workmanship and decoration were in the capital often superior to what
was to be found in a provincial town like Pompeii, is evidenced by
beautiful wall-paintings and reliefs discovered in Rome in 1879 and now
preserved in the Museo delle Terme. More or less fragmentary remains of
Roman houses have been found in almost every corner of the Roman empire,
but nowhere exhibiting as completely as in Pompeii the typical Roman
arrangement.</p>


<p><b>WORKS OF UTILITY.</b> A word should be said about Roman
engineering works, which in many cases were designed with an artistic
sense of proportion and form which raises them into the domain of
genuine art. Such were especially the bridges, in which a remarkable
effect of monumental grandeur was often produced by the form and
proportions of the arches and piers, and an appropriate use of rough and
dressed masonry, as in the Pons Ælius (Ponte S.&nbsp;Angelo), the great
bridge at Alcantara (Spain), and the Pont du Gard, in southern France.
The aqueducts are impressive rather by their length, scale, and
simplicity, than by any special refinements of design, except where
their arches are treated with some architectural decoration to form
gates, as in the Porta Maggiore, at Rome.</p>

<p><b>INTRODUCTORY.</b> The official recognition of Christianity in the
year 328 by Constantine simply legalized an institution which had been
for three centuries gathering momentum for its final conquest of the
antique world. The new religion rapidly enlisted in its service for a
common purpose and under a common impulse races as wide apart in blood
and culture as those which had built up the art of imperial Rome. It was
Christianity which reduced to civilization in the West the Germanic
hordes that had overthrown Rome, bringing their fresh and hitherto
untamed vigor to the task of recreating architecture out of the decaying
fragments of classic art. So in the East its life-giving influence awoke
the slumbering Greek art-instinct to new triumphs in the arts of
building, less refined and perfect indeed, but not less sublime than
those of the Periclean age. Long before the Constantinian edict, the
Christians in the Eastern provinces had enjoyed substantial freedom of
worship. Meeting often in the private basilicas of wealthy converts, and
<span class = "pagenum">111</span>
<a name = "page111" id = "page111"> </a>
finding these, and still more the great public basilicas, suited to the
requirements of their worship, they early began to build in imitation of
these edifices. There are many remains of these early churches in
northern Africa and central Syria.</p>


<p><b>EARLY CHRISTIAN ART IN ROME.</b> This was at first wholly
sepulchral, developing in the catacombs the symbols of the new faith.
Once liberated, however, Christianity appropriated bodily for its public
rites the basilica-type and the general substance of Roman architecture.
Shafts and capitals, architraves and rich linings of veined marble, even
the pagan Bacchic symbolism of the vine, it adapted to new uses in its
own service. Constantine led the way in architecture, endowing Bethlehem
and Jerusalem with splendid churches, and his new capital on the
Bosphorus with the first of the three historic basilicas dedicated to
the Holy Wisdom (Hagia Sophia). One of the greatest of innovators, he
seems to have had a special predilection for circular buildings, and the
tombs and baptisteries which he erected in this form, especially that
for his sister Constantia in Rome (known as Santa Costanza, Fig. 66),
furnished the prototype for numberless Italian baptisteries in later
ages.</p>

FIG. 66.&mdash;STA. COSTANZA, ROME.</p>

<p>The Christian basilica (see Figs. 67, 68) generally comprised a broad
and lofty nave, separated by rows of columns from the single or double
side-aisles. The aisles had usually about half the width and height of
the nave, and like it were covered with wooden roofs and ceilings. Above
the columns which flanked the nave rose the lofty clearstory wall,
pierced with windows above the side-aisle roofs and supporting the
immense trusses of the roof of the nave. The timbering of
<span class = "pagenum">112</span>
<a name = "page112" id = "page112"> </a>
the latter was sometimes bare, sometimes concealed by a richly panelled
ceiling, carved, gilded, and painted. At the further end of the nave was
the sanctuary or apse, with the seats for the clergy on a raised
platform, the <i>bema</i>, in front of which was the altar. Transepts
sometimes expanded to right and left before the altar, under which was
the <i>confessio</i> or shrine of the titular saint or martyr.</p>

<p>An <i>atrium</i> or forecourt surrounded by a covered arcade preceded
the basilica proper, the arcade at the front of the church forming a
porch or <i>narthex</i>, which, however, in some cases existed without
the atrium. The exterior was extremely plain; the interior, on the
contrary, was resplendent with incrustations of veined marble and with
sumptuous decorations in glass mosaic (called <i>opus Grecanicum</i>) on
a blue or golden ground. Especially rich were the half-dome of the apse
and the wall-space surrounding its arch and called the <i>triumphal
arch</i>; next in decorative importance came the broad band of wall
beneath the clearstory windows. Upon these surfaces the mosaic-workers
wrought with minute cubes of colored glass pictures and symbols almost
imperishable, in which the glow of color and a certain decorative
grandeur of effect in the composition went far to atone for the uncouth
drawing. With growing wealth and an increasingly elaborate ritual, the
furniture and equipments of the church assumed greater architectural
importance. A&nbsp;large rectangular space was retained for the choir in
front of the bema, and enclosed by a breast-high parapet of marble,
richly inlaid. On either side were the pulpits or <i>ambones</i> for the
Gospel and Epistle. A&nbsp;lofty canopy was built over the altar, the
<i>baldaquin</i>, supported on four marble columns. A&nbsp;few basilicas
were built with side-aisles, in two stories, as in S.&nbsp;Lorenzo and
Sta. Agnese. Adjoining the basilica in the earlier examples were the
baptistery and the tomb of the saint, circular or polygonal buildings
usually; but in later times these were replaced
<span class = "pagenum">113</span>
<a name = "page113" id = "page113"> </a>
by the font or baptismal chapel in the church and the <i>confessio</i>
under the altar.</p>

FIG. 67.&mdash;PLAN OF THE BASILICA OF ST.&nbsp;PAUL.</p>

<p>Of the two Constantinian basilicas in Rome, the one dedicated to
<b>St. Peter</b> was demolished in the fifteenth century; that of <b>St.
John Lateran</b> has been so disfigured by modern alterations as to be
unrecognizable. The former of the two adjoined the site of the martyrdom
of St. Peter in the circus of Caligula and Nero; it was five-aisled, 380
feet in length by 212 feet in width. The nave was 80 feet wide and 100
feet high, and the disproportionately high clearstory wall rested on
horizontal architraves carried by columns. The impressive dimensions and
simple plan of this structure gave it a majesty worthy of its rank as
the first church of Christendom. <b>St. Paul beyond the Walls</b>
(S.&nbsp;Paolo fuori le mura), built in 386 by Theodosius, resembled St.
Peter’s closely in plan (Figs. 67, 68). Destroyed by fire in 1821, it
has been rebuilt with almost its pristine splendor, and is, next to the
modern St. Peter’s and the Pantheon, the most impressive place of
worship in Rome. <b>Santa Maria Maggiore</b>,<a class = "tag" name =
"tag15" id = "tag15" href = "#note15">15</a> though smaller in size, is
more interesting because it so largely retains its original aspect, its
Renaissance ceiling happily harmonizing with its simple antique lines.
Ionic columns support architraves to carry the clearstory, as in St.
Peter’s. In most other examples, St. Paul’s included, arches turned from
column to column perform this function. The first known case of such use
of classic columns as arch-bearers was in the palace of Diocletian at
Spalato; it also appears in Syrian buildings of the third and fourth
centuries&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span></p>

<span class = "pagenum">114</span>
<a name = "page114" id = "page114"> </a>
<p>The basilica remained the model for ecclesiastical architecture in
Rome, without noticeable change either of plan or detail, until the time
of the Renaissance. All the earlier examples employed columns and
capitals taken from ancient ruins, often incongruous and ill-matched in
size and order. <b>San Clemente</b> (1084) has retained almost intact
its early aspect, its choir-enclosure, baldaquin, and ambones having
been well preserved or carefully restored. Other important basilicas are
mentioned in the list of monuments on pages 118, 119.</p>


<p><b>RAVENNA.</b> The fifth and sixth centuries endowed Ravenna with a
number of notable buildings which, with the exception of the cathedral,
demolished in the last century, have been preserved to our day. Subdued
by the Byzantine emperor Justinian in 537, Ravenna became the
meeting-ground for Early Christian and Byzantine traditions and the
basilican and circular plans are both represented. The two churches
dedicated to St. Apollinaris, <b>S.&nbsp;Apollinare Nuovo</b> (520) in
the city, and <b>S.&nbsp;Apollinare in Classe</b> (538) three miles
distant from the city, in what was formerly the port, are especially
interesting for their fine mosaics, and for the impost-blocks interposed
above the capitals of their columns to receive the springing of the
pier-arches. These blocks appear to be somewhat crude modifications
<span class = "pagenum">115</span>
<a name = "page115" id = "page115"> </a>
of the fragmentary architraves or entablatures employed in classic Roman
architecture to receive the springing of vaults sustained by columns,
and became common in Byzantine structures (<a href =
"#fig73">Fig.&nbsp;73</a>). The use of external arcading to give some
slight adornment to the walls of the second of the above-named churches,
and the round bell-towers of brick which adjoined both of them, were
first steps toward the development of the “wall-veil” or arcaded
decoration, and of the campaniles, which in later centuries became so
characteristic of north Italian churches (see Chapter XIII.). In Rome
the campaniles which accompany many of the mediæval basilicas are square
and pierced with many windows.</p>

<p>The basilican form of church became general in Italy, a&nbsp;large
proportion of whose churches continued to be built with wooden roofs and
with but slight deviations from the original type, long after the
appearance of the Gothic style. The chief departures from early
precedent were in the exterior, which was embellished with marble
incrustations as in S.&nbsp;Miniato (Florence); or with successive
stories of wall-arcades, as in many churches in Pisa and Lucca (see <a
href = "#fig90">Fig.&nbsp;90</a>); until finally the introduction of
clustered piers, pointed arches, and vaulting, gradually transformed the
basilican into the Italian Romanesque and Gothic styles.</p>


<p><b>SYRIA AND THE EAST.</b> In Syria, particularly the central
portion, the Christian architecture of the 3d to 8th centuries produced
a number of very interesting monuments. The churches built by
Constantine in Syria&mdash;the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem
(nominally built by his mother), of the Ascension at Jerusalem, the
magnificent octagonal church on the site of the Temple, and finally the
somewhat similar church at Antioch&mdash;were the most notable Christian
monuments in Syria. The first three on the list, still extant in part at
least, have been so altered by later
<span class = "pagenum">116</span>
<a name = "page116" id = "page116"> </a>
additions and restorations that their original forms are only
approximately known from early descriptions. They were all of large
size, and the octagonal church on the Temple platform was of exceptional
magnificence.<a class = "tag" name = "tag16" id = "tag16" href =
"#note16">16</a> The columns and a part of the marble incrustations of
the early design are still visible in the “Mosque of Omar,” but most of
the old work is concealed by the decoration of tiles applied by the
Moslems, and the whole interior aspect altered by the wood-and-plaster
dome with which they replaced the simpler roof of the original.</p>

FIG. 69.&mdash;CHURCH AT KALB LOUZEH.</p>

<p>Christian architecture in Syria soon, however, diverged from Roman
traditions. The abundance of hard stone, the total lack of clay or
brick, the remoteness from Rome, led to a peculiar independence and
originality in the forms and details of the ecclesiastical as well as of
the domestic architecture of central Syria. These innovations upon Roman
models resulted in the development of distinct types which, but for the
arrest of progress by the Mohammedan conquest in the seventh century,
would doubtless have inaugurated a new and independent style of
architecture. Piers of masonry came
<span class = "pagenum">117</span>
<a name = "page117" id = "page117"> </a>
to replace the classic column, as at Tafkha (third or fourth century),
Rouheiha and Kalb Louzeh (fifth century? Fig. 69); the ceilings in the
smaller churches were often formed with stone slabs; the apse was at
first confined within the main rectangle of the plan, and was sometimes
square. The exterior assumed a striking and picturesque variety of forms
by means of turrets, porches, and gables. Singularly enough, vaulting
hardly appears at all, though the arch is used with fine effect.
Conventional and monastic groups of buildings appear early in Syria, and
that of <b>St. Simeon Stylites</b> at Kelat Seman is an impressive and
interesting monument. Four three-aisled wings form the arms of a cross,
meeting in a central octagonal open court, in the midst of which stood
the column of the saint. The eastern arm of the cross forms a complete
basilica of itself, and the whole cross measures 330 × 300 feet.
Chapels, cloisters, and cells adjoin the main edifice.</p>

FIG. 70.&mdash;CATHEDRAL AT BOZRAH.</p>

<p>Circular and polygonal plans appear in a number of Syrian examples of
the early sixth century. Their most striking feature is the inscribing
of the circle or polygon in a square which forms the exterior outline,
and the use of four niches to fill out the corners. This occurs at Kelat
Seman in a small double church, perhaps the tomb and chapel of a martyr;
in the cathedral at <b>Bozrah</b> (Fig. 70), and in the small domical
church of <b>St. George</b> at <b>Ezra</b>. These were probably the
prototypes of many Byzantine churches like St. Sergius at
Constantinople, and San Vitale at Ravenna (<a href =
"#fig74">Fig.&nbsp;74</a>), though the exact dates of the Syrian
<span class = "pagenum">118</span>

churches are not known. The one at Ezra is the only one of the three
which has a dome, the others having been roofed with wood.</p>

<p>The interesting domestic architecture of this period is preserved in
whole towns and villages in the Hauran, which, deserted at the Arab
conquest, have never been reoccupied and remain almost intact but for
the decay of their wooden roofs. They are marked by dignity and
simplicity of design, and by the same picturesque massing of gables and
roofs and porches which has already been remarked of the churches. The
arches are broad, the columns rather heavy, the mouldings few and
simple, and the scanty carving vigorous and effective, often strongly
Byzantine in type.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the Eastern world are many early churches of which even
the enumeration would exceed the limits of this work. Salonica counts a
number of basilicas and several domical churches. The church of <b>St.
George</b>, now a mosque, is of early date and thoroughly Roman in plan
and section, of the same class with the Pantheon and the tomb of Helena,
in both of which a massive circular wall is lightened by eight niches.
At Angora (Ancyra), Hierapolis, Pergamus, and other points in Asia
Minor; in Egypt, Nubia, and Algiers, are many examples of both circular
and basilican edifices of the early centuries of Christianity. In
Constantinople there remains but a single representative of the
basilican type, the church of <b>St. John Studius</b>, now the Emir
Akhor mosque.</p>

Fergusson (<i>History of Architecture</i>, vol. ii., pp. 408, 432)
contends that this was the real Constantinian church of the Holy
Sepulchre, and that the one called to-day by that name was erected by
the Crusaders in the twelfth century. The more general view is that the
latter was originally built by Constantine as the Church of the
Sepulchre, though subsequently much altered, and that the octagonal
edifice was also his work, but erected under some other name. Whether
this church was later incorporated in the “Mosque of Omar,” or merely
furnished some of the materials for its construction, is not quite
clear.</p>

<p><b>ORIGIN AND CHARACTER.</b> The decline and fall of Rome arrested
the development of the basilican style in the West, as did the Arab
conquest later in Syria. It was otherwise in the new Eastern capital
founded by Constantine in the ancient Byzantium, which was rising in
power and wealth while Rome lay in ruins. Situated at the strategic
point of the natural highway of commerce between East and West,
salubrious and enchantingly beautiful in its surroundings, the new
capital grew rapidly from provincial insignificance to metropolitan
importance. Its founder had embellished it with an extraordinary wealth
of buildings, in which, owing to the scarcity of trained architects,
quantity and cost doubtless outran quality. But at least the tameness of
blindly followed precedent was avoided, and this departure from
traditional tenets contributed undoubtedly to the originality of
Byzantine architecture. A&nbsp;large part of the artisans employed in
building were then, as now, from Asia Minor and the Ægean Islands, Greek
in race if not in name. An Oriental taste for brilliant and harmonious
color and for minute decoration spread over broad
<span class = "pagenum">121</span>
<a name = "page121" id = "page121"> </a>
surfaces must have been stimulated by trade with the Far East and by
constant contact with Oriental peoples, costumes, and arts. An Asiatic
origin may also be assigned to the methods of vaulting employed, far
more varied than the Roman, not only in form but also in materials and
processes. From Roman architecture, however, the Byzantines borrowed the
fundamental notion of their structural art; that, namely, of
distributing the weights and strains of their vaulted structures upon
isolated and massive points of support, strengthened by deep buttresses,
internal or external, as the case might be. Roman, likewise, was the use
of polished monolithic columns, and the incrustation of the piers and
walls with panels of variegated marble, as well as the decoration of
plastered surfaces by fresco and mosaic, and the use of <i>opus
sectile</i> and <i>opus Alexandrinum</i> for the production of sumptuous
marble pavements. In the first of these processes the color-figures of
the pattern are formed each of a single piece of marble cut to the shape
required; in the second the pattern is compounded of minute squares,
triangles, and curved pieces of uniform size. Under these combined
influences the artists of Constantinople wrought out new problems in
construction and decoration, giving to all that they touched a new and
striking character.</p>

<p>There is no absolute line of demarcation, chronological,
geographical, or structural, between Early Christian and Byzantine
architecture. But the former was especially characterized by the
basilica with three or five aisles, and the use of wooden roofs even in
its circular edifices; the vault and dome, though not unknown, being
exceedingly rare. Byzantine architecture, on the other hand, rarely
produced the simple three-aisled or five-aisled basilica, and nearly all
its monuments were vaulted. The dome was especially frequent, and
Byzantine architecture achieved its highest triumphs in the use of the
<i>pendentive</i>, as the triangular spherical surfaces are called, by
the aid of which a
<span class = "pagenum">122</span>
<a name = "page122" id = "page122"> </a>
dome can be supported on the summits of four arches spanning the four
sides of a square, as explained later. There is as little uniformity in
the plans of Byzantine buildings as in the forms of the vaulting.
A&nbsp;few types of church-plan, however, predominated locally in one or
another centre; but the controlling feature of the style was the dome
and the constructive system with which it was associated. The dome, it
is true, had long been used by the Romans, but always on a circular
plan, as in the Pantheon. It is also a fact that pendentives have been
found in Syria and Asia Minor older than the oldest Byzantine examples.
But the special feature characterizing the Byzantine dome on pendentives
was its almost exclusive association with plans having piers and columns
or aisles, with the dome as the central and dominant feature of the
complex design (see plans, Figs. <a href = "#fig74">74</a>, <a href =
"#fig75">75</a>, <a href = "#fig78">78</a>). Another strictly Byzantine
practice was the piercing of the lower portion of the dome with windows
forming a circle or crown, and the final development of this feature
into a high drum.</p>


<p><b>CONSTRUCTION.</b> Still another divergence from Roman methods was
in the substitution of brick and stone masonry for concrete. Brick was
used for the mass as well as the facing of walls and piers, and for the
vaulting in many buildings mainly built of stone. Stone was used either
alone or in combination with brick, the latter appearing in bands of
four or five courses at intervals of three or four feet. In later work a
regular alternation of the two materials, course for course, was not
uncommon. In piers intended to support unusually heavy loads the stone
was very carefully cut and fitted, and sometimes tied and clamped with
iron.</p>

<p>Vaults were built sometimes of brick, sometimes of cut stone; in a
few cases even of earthenware jars fitting into each other, and laid up
in a continuous contracting spiral from the base to the crown of a dome,
as in San Vitale at
<span class = "pagenum">123</span>
<a name = "page123" id = "page123"> </a>
Ravenna. Ingenious processes for building vaults without centrings were
made use of&mdash;processes inherited from the drain-builders of ancient
Assyria, and still in vogue in Armenia, Persia, and Asia Minor. The
groined vault was common, but always approximated the form of a dome, by
a longitudinal convexity upward in the intersecting vaults. The aisles
of Hagia Sophia<a class = "tag" name = "tag17" id = "tag17" href =
"#note17">17</a> display a remarkable variety of forms in the
vaulting.</p>

FIG. 71.&mdash;DIAGRAM OF PENDENTIVES.</p>

<p><b>DOMES.</b> The dome, as we have seen, early became the most
characteristic feature of Byzantine architecture; and especially the
dome on pendentives. If a hemisphere be cut by five planes, four
perpendicular to its base and bounding a square inscribed therein, and
the fifth plane parallel to the base and tangent to the semicircular
intersections made by the first four, there will remain of the original
surface only four triangular spaces bounded by arcs of circles. These
are called <i>pendentives</i> (Fig. 71&nbsp;<i>a</i>). When these are
built up of masonry, each course forms a species of arch, by virtue of
its convexity. At the crown of the four arches on which they rest, these
courses meet and form a complete circle, perfectly stable and capable of
sustaining any superstructure that does not by excessive weight disrupt
the whole fabric by overthrowing
<span class = "pagenum">124</span>
<a name = "page124" id = "page124"> </a>
the four arches which support it. Upon these pendentives, then,
a&nbsp;new dome may be started of any desired curvature, or even a
cylindrical drum to support a still loftier dome, as in the later
churches (Fig. 71&nbsp;<i>b</i>). This method of covering a square is
simpler than the groined vault, having no sharp edges or intersections;
it is at least as effective architecturally, by reason of its greater
height in the centre; and is equally applicable to successive bays of an
oblong, cruciform, and even columnar building. In the great cisterns at
Constantinople vast areas are covered by rows of small domes supported
on ranges of columns.</p>

<p>The earlier domes were commonly pierced with windows at the base,
this apparent weakening of the vault being compensated for by strongly
buttressing the piers between the windows, as in Hagia Sophia. Here
forty windows form a crown of light at the spring of the dome, producing
an effect almost as striking as that of the simple <i>oculus</i> of the
Pantheon, and celebrated by ancient writers in the most extravagant
terms. In later and smaller churches a high drum was introduced beneath
the dome, in order to secure, by means of longer windows, more light
than could be obtained by merely piercing the diminutive domes.</p>

<p>Buttressing was well understood by the Byzantines, whose plans were
skilfully devised to provide internal abutments, which were often
continued above the roofs of the side-aisles to prop the main vaults,
precisely as was done by the Romans in their thermæ and similar halls.
But the Byzantines, while adhering less strictly than the Romans to
traditional forms and processes, and displaying much more ready
contrivance and special adaptation of means to ends, never worked out
this pregnant structural principle to its logical conclusion as did the
Gothic architects of Western Europe a few centuries later.</p>


<p><b>DECORATION</b>. The exteriors of Byzantine buildings (except in
some of the small churches of late date) were
<span class = "pagenum">125</span>
<a name = "page125" id = "page125"> </a>
generally bare and lacking in beauty. The interiors, on the contrary,
were richly decorated, color playing a much larger part than carving in
the designs. Painting was resorted to only in the smaller buildings, the
more durable and splendid medium of mosaic being usually preferred. This
was, as a rule, confined to the vaults and to those portions of the
wall-surfaces embraced by the vaults above their springing. The colors
were brilliant, the background being usually of gold, though sometimes
of blue or a delicate green. Biblical scenes, symbolic and allegorical
figures and groups of saints adorned the larger areas, particularly the
half-dome of the apse, as in the basilicas. The smaller vaults, the
soffits of arches, borders of pictures, and other minor surfaces,
received a more conventional decoration of crosses, monograms, and set
patterns.</p>

FIG. 72.&mdash;SPANDRIL. HAGIA SOPHIA.</p>

<p>The walls throughout were sheathed with slabs of rare marble in
panels so disposed that the veining should produce symmetrical figures.
The panels were framed in billet-mouldings, derived perhaps from classic
dentils; the billets or projections on one side the moulding coming
opposite the spaces on the other. This seems to have been a purely
Byzantine feature.</p>


<p><b>CARVED DETAILS.</b> Internally the different stories were marked
by horizontal bands and cornices of white or inlaid marble richly
carved. The arch-soffits, the archivolts or
<span class = "pagenum">126</span>
<a name = "page126" id = "page126"> </a>
bands around the arches, and the spandrils between them were covered
with minute and intricate incised carving. The motives used, though
based on the acanthus and anthemion, were given a wholly new aspect. The
relief was low and flat, the leaves sharp and crowded, and the effect
rich and lacelike, rather than vigorous. It was, however, well adapted
to the covering of large areas where general effect was more important
than detail. Even the capitals were treated in the same spirit. The
impost-block was almost universal, except where its use was rendered
unnecessary by giving to the capital itself the massive pyramidal form
required to receive properly the spring of the arch or vault. In such
cases (more frequent in Constantinople than elsewhere) the surface of
the capital was simply covered with incised carving of foliage,
basketwork, monograms, etc.; rudimentary volutes in a few cases
recalling classic traditions (Figs. 72, 73). The mouldings were weak and
poorly executed, and the vigorous profiles of classic cornices were only
remotely suggested by the characterless aggregations of mouldings which
took their place.</p>

FIG. 74.&mdash;ST. SERGIUS, CONSTANTINOPLE.</p>

<p><b>PLANS.</b> The remains of Byzantine architecture are almost
exclusively of churches and baptisteries, but the plans of these are
exceedingly varied. The first radical departure
<span class = "pagenum">127</span>
<a name = "page127" id = "page127"> </a>
from the basilica-type seems to have been the adoption of circular or
polygonal plans, such as had usually served only for tombs and
baptisteries. The Baptistery of St. John at Ravenna (early fifth
century) is classed by many authorities as a Byzantine monument. In the
early years of the sixth century the adoption of this model had become
quite general, and with it the development of domical design began to
advance. The church of <b>St. Sergius</b> at Constantinople (Fig. 74),
originally joined to a short basilica dedicated to St. Bacchus
(afterward destroyed by the Turks), as in the double church at Kelat
Seman, was built about 520; that of <b>San Vitale</b> at Ravenna was
begun a few years later; both are domical churches on an octagonal plan,
with an exterior aisle. Semicircular niches&mdash;four in St. Sergius
and eight in San Vitale&mdash;projecting into the aisle, enlarge
somewhat the area of the central space and give variety to the internal
effect. The origin of this characteristic feature may be traced to the
eight niches of the Pantheon, through such intermediate examples as the
temple of Minerva Medica at Rome. The true pendentive does not appear in
these two churches.

FIG. 75.&mdash;PLAN OF HAGIA SOPHIA.</span>
Timidly employed up to that time in small structures, it received a
remarkable development in the magnificent church of <b>Hagia Sophia</b>,
built by Anthemius of Tralles and Isodorus of Miletus, under Justinian,
532&ndash;538 <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> In the plan of this
marvellous edifice (Fig. 75) the dome rests upon four mighty arches
bounding a square, into two of which open the half-domes of semicircular
apses. These apses are penetrated and extended each by two smaller
niches and a central arch, and the whole vast nave, measuring over 200 ×
100 feet, is flanked by
<span class = "pagenum">128</span>
<a name = "page128" id = "page128"> </a>
enormously wide aisles connecting at the front with a majestic narthex.
Huge transverse buttresses, as in the Basilica of Constantine (with
whose structural design this building shows striking affinities), divide
the aisles each into three sections. The plan suggests that of St.
Sergius cut in two, with a lofty dome on pendentives over a square plan
inserted between the halves. Thus was secured a noble and unobstructed
hall of unrivalled proportions and great beauty, covered by a
combination of half-domes increasing in span and height as they lead up
successively to the stupendous central vault, which rises 180 feet into
the air and fitly crowns the whole. The imposing effect of this
low-curved but loftily-poised dome, resting as it does upon a crown of
windows, and so disposed that its summit is visible from every point of
the nave (as may be easily seen from an examination of the section, Fig.
76), is not surpassed in any interior ever erected.</p>

<p>The two lateral arches under the dome are filled by clearstory walls
pierced by twelve windows, and resting on arcades in two stories carried
by magnificent columns taken from ancient ruins. These separate the nave
from the side-aisles, which are in two stories forming galleries, and
are vaulted with a remarkable variety of groined vaults. All the masses
are disposed with studied reference to the resistance required by the
many and complex thrusts exerted by the dome and other vaults. That the
earthquakes of one thousand three hundred and fifty years have not
destroyed the church is the best evidence of the sufficiency of these
precautions.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">131</span>
<p>Not less remarkable than the noble planning and construction of this
church was the treatment of scale and decoration in its interior design.
It was as conspicuously the masterpiece of Byzantine architecture as the
Parthenon was of the classic Greek. With little external beauty, it is
internally one of the most perfectly composed and beautifully decorated
halls of worship ever erected. Instead of the simplicity of the Pantheon
it displays the complexity of an organism of admirably related parts.
The division of the interior height into two stories below the spring of
the four arches, reduces the component parts of the design to moderate
dimensions, so that the scale of the whole is more easily grasped and
its vast size emphasized by the contrast. The walls are incrusted with
precious marbles up to the spring of the vaulting; the capitals,
spandrils, and soffits are richly and minutely carved with incised
ornament, and all the vaults covered with splendid mosaics. Dimmed by
the lapse of centuries and disfigured by the vandalism of the Moslems,
this noble interior, by the harmony of its coloring and its impressive
grandeur, is one of the masterpieces of all time (Fig. 77).</p>


<p><b>LATER CHURCHES.</b> After the sixth century no monuments were
built at all rivalling in scale the creations of the
<span class = "pagenum">132</span>
<a name = "page132" id = "page132"> </a>
former period. The later churches were, with few exceptions, relatively
small and trivial. Neither the plan nor the general aspect of Hagia
Sophia seems to have been imitated in these later works. The crown of
dome-windows was replaced by a cylindrical drum under the dome, which
was usually of insignificant size. The exterior was treated more
decoratively than before, by means of bands and incrustations of colored
marble, or alternations of stone and brick; and internally mosaic
continued to be executed with great skill and of great beauty until the
tenth century, when the art rapidly declined. These later churches, of
which a number were spared by the Turks, are, therefore, generally
pleasing and elegant rather than striking or imposing.</p>

FIG. 78.&mdash;PLAN OF ST. MARK’S, VENICE.</p>

<p><b>FOREIGN MONUMENTS.</b> The influence of Byzantine art was
wide-spread, both in Europe and Asia. The leading city of civilization
through the Dark Ages, Constantinople influenced Italy through her
political and commercial relations with Ravenna, Genoa, and Venice. The
church of <b>St. Mark</b> in the latter city was one result of this
influence (Figs. 78, 79). Begun in 1063 to replace an earlier church
destroyed by fire, it received through several centuries additions not
always Byzantine in character. Yet it was mainly the work of Byzantine
builders, who copied most probably the church of the Apostles at
Constantinople, built by Justinian. The picturesque but wholly
unstructural use of columns in the entrance porches, the upper parts of
the façade, the wooden cupolas over the five domes, and the pointed
arches in the narthex, are deviations from Byzantine traditions dating
in part from the later Middle Ages
<span class = "pagenum">133</span>
<a name = "page133" id = "page133"> </a>
Nothing could well be conceived more irrational, from a structural point
of view, than the accumulation of columns in the entrance-arches; but
the total effect is so picturesque and so rich in color, that its
architectural defects are easily overlooked. The external veneering of
white and colored marble occurs rarely in the East, but became a
favorite practice in Venice, where it continued in use for five hundred
years. The interior of St. Mark’s, in some respects better preserved
than that of Hagia Sophia, is especially fine in color, though not equal
in scale and grandeur to the latter church. With its five domes it has
less unity of effect than Hagia Sophia, but more of the charm of
picturesqueness, and its less brilliant and simpler lighting enhances
the impressiveness of its more modest dimensions.</p>

<p>In Russia and Greece the Byzantine style has continued to be the
official style of the Greek Church. The Russian monuments are for the
most part of a somewhat fantastic aspect, the Muscovite taste having
introduced many innovations in the form of bulbous domes and other
eccentric details. In Greece there are few large churches, and some of
the most interesting, like the Cathedral at Athens, are almost toy-like
in their diminutiveness. On <b>Mt. Athos</b> (Hagion Oros) is an ancient
monastery which still retains its Byzantine character and traditions. In
Armenia (as at Ani, Etchmiadzin, etc.) are also interesting examples of
late Armeno-Byzantine architecture, showing applications to exterior
carved detail of elaborate interlaced ornament looking like a re-echo of
Celtic MSS. illumination, itself, no doubt, originating in Byzantine
traditions. But the greatest and most prolific offspring of Byzantine
architecture appeared after the fall of Constantinople (1453) in the new
mosque-architecture of the victorious Turks.</p>

<p><b>GENERAL SURVEY.</b> While the Byzantine Empire was at its zenith,
the new faith of Islam was conquering Western Asia and the Mediterranean
lands with a fiery rapidity, which is one of the marvels of history. The
new architectural styles which grew up in the wake of these conquests,
though differing widely in conception and detail in the several
countries, were yet marked by common characteristics which set them
quite apart from the contemporary Christian styles. The predominance of
decorative over structural considerations, a&nbsp;predilection for
minute surface-ornament, the absence of pictures and sculpture, are
found alike in Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Indian buildings, though in
varying degree. These new styles, however, were almost entirely the
handiwork of artisans belonging to the
<span class = "pagenum">136</span>
<a name = "page136" id = "page136"> </a>
conquered races, and many traces of Byzantine, and even after the
Crusades, of Norman and Gothic design, are recognizable in Moslem
architecture. But the Orientalism of the conquerors and their common
faith, tinged with the poetry and philosophic mysticism of the Arab,
stamped these works of Copts, Syrians, and Greeks with an unmistakable
character of their own, neither Byzantine nor Early Christian.</p>


<p><b>ARABIC ARCHITECTURE.</b> In the building of mosques and tombs,
especially at Cairo, this architecture reached a remarkable degree of
decorative elegance, and sometimes of dignity. It developed slowly, the
Arabs not being at the outset a race of builders. The early monuments of
Syria and Egypt were insignificant, and the sacred <i>Kaabah</i> at
Mecca and the mosque at Medina hardly deserve to be called architectural
monuments at all. The most important early works were the mosques of
<b>’Amrou</b> at Cairo (642, rebuilt and enlarged early in the eighth
century), of <b>El Aksah</b> on the Temple platform at Jerusalem (691,
by Abd-el-Melek), and of <b>El Walid</b> at Damascus (705&ndash;732,
recently seriously injured by fire). All these were simple one-storied
structures, with flat wooden roofs carried on parallel ranges of columns
supporting pointed arches, the arcades either closing one side of a
square court, or surrounding it completely. The long perspectives of the
aisles and the minute decoration of the archivolts and ceilings alone
gave them architectural character. The beautiful <b>Dome of the Rock</b>
(Kubbet-es-Sakhrah, miscalled the Mosque of Omar) on the Temple platform
at Jerusalem is either a remodelled Constantinian edifice, or in large
part composed of the materials of one (see <a href =
"#page116">p.&nbsp;116</a>).</p>

<p>The splendid mosque of <b>Ibn Touloun</b> (876&ndash;885) was built
on the same plan as that of Amrou, but with cantoned piers instead of
columns and a corresponding increase in variety of perspective and
richness of effect. With the incoming
<span class = "pagenum">137</span>
<a name = "page137" id = "page137"> </a>
of the Fatimite dynasty, however, and the foundation of the present city
of Cairo (971), vaulting began to take the place of wooden ceilings, and
then appeared the germs of those extraordinary applications of geometry
to decorative design which were henceforth to be the most striking
feature of Arabic ornament. Under the Ayûb dynasty, which began with
Salâh-ed-din (Saladin) in 1172, these elements, of which the great
<b>Barkouk</b> mosque (1149) is the most imposing early example,
developed slowly in the domical tombs of the <i>Karafah</i> at Cairo,
and prepared the way for the increasing richness and splendor of a long
series of mosques, among which those of <b>Kalaoun</b>
(1284&ndash;1318), <b>Sultan Hassan</b> (1356), <b>El Mu’ayyad</b>
(1415), and <b>Kaîd Bey</b> (1463), were the most conspicuous examples
(Fig. 80). They mark, indeed, successive advances in complexity of
planning, ingenuity of construction, and elegance of decoration.
Together they constitute an epoch in Arabic architecture, which
coincides closely with the development of Gothic

vaulted architecture in Europe, both in the stages and the duration of
its advances.</p>

<span class = "caption">
<i>a, Mihrâb, b, Mimber.</i></span></p>

<p>The mosques of these three centuries are, like the mediæval
monasteries, impressive aggregations of buildings of various sorts about
a central court of ablutions. The tomb of the founder, residences for
the <i>imams</i>, or priests, schools (<i>madrassah</i>), and hospitals
(<i>mâristân</i>) rival in importance the prayer-chamber. This last is,
however, the real focus of interest and splendor; in some cases, as in
Sultan Hassan, it is a simple barrel-vaulted chamber open to the court;
in others an oblong arcaded hall with many small domes; or again,
a&nbsp;square hall covered with a high pointed dome on pendentives of
intricately beautiful stalactite-work (see below). The ceremonial
requirements of the mosque were simple. The-court must have its fountain
of ablutions in the centre. The prayer-hall, or mosque proper, must have
its <i>mihrâb</i>, or niche, to indicate the <i>kibleh</i>, the
direction of Mecca; and its <i>mimber</i>, or high, slender pulpit for
the reading of the Kôran. These were the only absolutely indispensable
features of a mosque, but as early as the ninth century the
<i>minaret</i> was added, from which the call to prayer could be sounded
over the city by the <i>mueddin</i>. Not until the Ayubite period,
however, did it begin to assume those forms of varied and picturesque
grace which lend to Cairo so much of its architectural charm.</p>


<p><b>ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS.</b> While Arabic architecture, in Syria and
Egypt alike, possesses more decorative than constructive originality,
the beautiful forms of its domes, pendentives, and minarets, the simple
majesty of the great pointed barrel-vaults of the Hassan mosque and
similar monuments, and the graceful lines of the universally used
pointed arch, prove the Coptic builders and their later Arabic
successors to have been architects of great ability. The Arabic domes,
as seen both in the mosques and in the remarkable group of tombs
commonly called “tombs of the
<span class = "pagenum">139</span>
<a name = "page139" id = "page139"> </a>
Khalîfs,” are peculiar not only in their pointed outlines and their rich
external decoration of interlaced geometric motives, but still more in
the external and internal treatment of the pendentives, exquisitely
decorated with stalactite ornament. This ornament, derived, no doubt,
from a combination of minute corbels with rows of small niches, and
presumably of Persian origin, was finally developed into a system of
extraordinary intricacy, applicable alike to the topping of a niche or
panel, as in the great doorways of the mosques, and to the bracketing
out of minaret galleries (Figs. 81, <a href = "#fig82">82</a>). Its
applications show a bewildering variety of forms and an extraordinary
aptitude for intricate geometrical design.</p>

FIG. 81.&mdash;MOSQUE OF KAÎD BEY, CAIRO.</p>


<p><b>DECORATION.</b> Geometry, indeed, vied with the love of color in
its hold on the Arabic taste. Ceiling-beams were carved into highly
ornamental forms before receiving their rich color-decoration of red,
green, blue, and gold. The doors and the <i>mimber</i> were framed in
geometric patterns with slender intersecting bars forming complicated
star-panelling. The voussoirs of arches were cut into curious
interlocking forms; doorways and niches were covered with stalactite
corbelling, and pavements and wall-incrustations,
<span class = "pagenum">140</span>
<a name = "page140" id = "page140"> </a>
whether of marble or tiling, combined brilliancy and harmony of color
with the perplexing beauty of interlaced star-and-polygon patterns of
marvellous intricacy. Stained glass added to the interior color-effect,
the patterns being perforated in plaster, with a bit of colored glass
set into each perforation&mdash;a&nbsp;device not very durable, perhaps,
but singularly decorative.</p>


<p><b>OTHER WORKS.</b> Few of the mediæval Arabic palaces have remained
to our time. That they were adorned with a splendid prodigality appears
from contemporary accounts. This splendor was internal rather than
external; the palace, like all the larger and richer dwellings in the
East, surrounded one or more courts, and presented externally an almost
unbroken wall. The fountain in the chief court, the <i>diwân</i>
(a&nbsp;great, vaulted reception-chamber opening upon the court and
raised slightly above it), the <i>dâr</i>, or men’s court, rigidly
separated from the <i>hareem</i> for the women, were and are universal
elements in these great dwellings. The more common city-houses show as
their most striking features successively corbelled-out stories and
broad wooden eaves, with lattice-screens covering single windows, or
almost a whole façade, composed of turned work (<i>mashrabiyya</i>), in
designs of great beauty.</p>

<p>The fountains, gates, and minor works of the Arabs display the same
beauty in decoration and color, the same general forms and details which
characterize the larger works, but it is impossible here to
particularize further with regard to them.</p>

<i>Showing stalactite and perforated work, Moorish cusped arch,

<p><b>MORESQUE.</b> Elsewhere in Northern Africa the Arabs produced no
such important works as in Egypt, nor is the architecture of the other
Moslem states so well preserved or so well known. Constructive design
would appear to have been there even more completely subordinated to
decoration; tiling and plaster-relief took the place of more
architectural elements and materials, while horseshoe and cusped
<span class = "pagenum">141</span>
<a name = "page141" id = "page141"> </a>
arches were substituted for the simpler and more architectural pointed
arch (Fig. 82). The courts of palaces and public buildings were
surrounded by ranges of horseshoe arches on slender columns; these last
being provided with capitals of a form rarely seen in Cairo. Towers were
built of much more massive design than the Cairo minarets, usually with
a square, almost solid shaft and a more open lantern at the top,
sometimes in several diminishing stories.</p>


<p><b>HISPANO-MORESQUE.</b> The most splendid phase of this branch of
Arabic architecture is found not in Africa but in Spain, which was
overrun in 710&ndash;713 by the Moors, who established there the
independent Khalifate of Cordova. This was later split up into petty
kingdoms, of which the most important were Granada, Seville, Toledo, and
Valencia. This dismemberment of the Khalifate led in time to the loss of
these cities, which were one by one recovered by the Christians during
the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries;
<span class = "pagenum">142</span>
<a name = "page142" id = "page142"> </a>
the capture of Granada, in 1492, finally destroying the Moorish
rule.</p>

<p>The dominion of the Moors in Spain was marked by a high civilization
and an extraordinary activity in building. The style they introduced
became the national style in the regions they occupied, and even after
the expulsion of the Moors was used in buildings erected by Christians
and by Jews. The “House of Pilate,” at Seville, is an example of this,
and the general use of the Moorish style in Jewish synagogues, down to
our own day, both in Spain and abroad, originated in the erection of
synagogues for the Jews in Spain by Moorish artisans and in Moorish
style, both during and after the period of Moslem supremacy.</p>

<p>Besides innumerable mosques, castles, bridges, aqueducts, gates, and
fountains, the Moors erected several monuments of remarkable size and
magnificence. Specially worthy of notice among them are the Great Mosque
at Cordova, the Alcazars of Seville and Malaga, the Giralda at Seville,
and the Alhambra at Granada.</p>

FIG. 83.&mdash;INTERIOR OF THE GREAT MOSQUE AT CORDOVA.</p>

<p>The <b>Mosque at Cordova</b>, begun in 786 by ‘Abd-er-Rahman,
enlarged in 876, and again by El Mansour in 976, is a vast arcaded hall
375 feet × 420 feet in extent, but only 30
<span class = "pagenum">143</span>
<a name = "page143" id = "page143"> </a>
feet high (Fig. 83). The rich wooden ceiling rests upon seventeen rows
of thirty to thirty-three columns each, and two intersecting rows of
piers, all carrying horseshoe arches in two superposed ranges,
a&nbsp;large portion of those about the sanctuary being cusped, the
others plain, except for the alternation of color in the voussoirs. The
<i>mihrâb</i> niche is particularly rich in its minutely carved
incrustations and mosaics, and a dome ingeniously formed by intersecting
ribs covers the sanctuary before it. This form of dome occurs frequently
in Spain.</p>

<p>The <b>Alcazars</b> at Seville and Malaga, which have been restored
in recent years, present to-day a fairly correct counterpart of the
castle-palaces of the thirteenth century. They display the same general
conceptions and decorative features as the Alhambra, which they
antedate. The <b>Giralda</b> at Seville is, on the other hand, unique.
It is a lofty rectangular tower, its exterior panelled and covered with
a species of quarry-ornament in relief; it terminated originally in two
or three diminishing stages or lanterns, which were replaced in the
sixteenth century by the present Renaissance belfry.</p>

<p>The <b>Alhambra</b> is universally considered to be the masterpiece
of Hispano-Moresque art, partly no doubt on account of its excellent
preservation. It is most interesting as an example of the splendid
citadel-palaces built by the Moorish conquerors, as well as for its
gorgeous color-decoration of minute quarry-ornament stamped or moulded
in the wet plaster wherever the walls are not wainscoted with tiles. It
was begun in 1248 by Mohammed-ben-Al-Hamar, enlarged in 1279 by his
successor, and again in 1306, when its mosque was built. Its plan (Fig.
84) shows two large courts and a smaller one next the mosque, with three
great square chambers and many of minor importance. Light arcades
surround the Court of the Lions with its fountain, and adorn the ends of
the other chief court; and the stalactite
<span class = "pagenum">144</span>
<a name = "page144" id = "page144"> </a>
pendentive, rare in Moorish work, appears in the “Hall of Ambassadors”
and some other parts of the edifice. But its chief glory is its
ornamentation, less durable, less architectural than that of the Cairene
buildings, but making up for this in delicacy and richness. Minute
vine-patterns and Arabic inscriptions are interwoven with waving
intersecting lines, forming a net-like framework, to all of which deep
red, blue, black, and gold give an indescribable richness of effect.</p>

<p>The Moors also overran Sicily in the eighth century, but while their
architecture there profoundly influenced that of the Christians who
recovered Sicily in 1090, and copied the style of the conquered Moslems,
there is too little of the original Moorish architecture remaining to
claim mention here.</p>


<p><b>SASSANIAN.</b> The Sassanian empire, which during the four
centuries from 226 to 641 <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> had
withstood Rome and extended its own sway almost to India, left on
Persian soil a number of interesting monuments which powerfully
influenced the Mohammedan style of that region. The Sassanian buildings
appear to have been principally palaces, and were all vaulted. With
their long barrel-vaulted halls, combined with square domical chambers,
as in Firouz-Abad and Serbistan, they exhibit reminiscences of antique
Assyrian tradition.
<span class = "pagenum">145</span>
<a name = "page145" id = "page145"> </a>
The ancient Persian use of columns was almost entirely abandoned, but
doors and windows were still treated with the banded frames and
cavetto-cornices of Persepolis and Susa. The Sassanians employed with
these exterior details others derived perhaps from Syrian and Byzantine
sources. A&nbsp;sort of engaged buttress-column and blind arches
repeated somewhat aimlessly over a whole façade were characteristic
features; still more so the huge arches, elliptical or horse-shoe
shaped, which formed the entrances to these palaces, as in the Tâk-Kesra
at Ctesiphon. Ornamental details of a debased Roman type appear, mingled
with more gracefully flowing leaf-patterns resembling early Christian
Syrian carving. The last great monument of this style was the palace at
Mashita in Moab, begun by the last Chosroes (627), but never finished,
an imposing and richly ornamented structure about 500 × 170 feet,
occupying the centre of a great court.</p>


<p><b>PERSIAN-MOSLEM ARCHITECTURE.</b> These Sassanian palaces must have
strongly influenced Persian architecture after the Arab conquest in 641.
For although the architecture of the first six centuries after that date
suffered almost absolute extinction at the hands of the Mongols under
Genghis Khan, the traces of Sassanian influence are still perceptible in
the monuments that rose in the following centuries. The dome and vault,
the colossal portal-arches, and the use of brick and tile are evidences
of this influence, bearing no resemblance to Byzantine or Arabic types.
The Moslem monuments of Persia, so far as their dates can be
ascertained, are all subsequent to 1200, unless tradition is correct in
assigning to the time of Haroun <ins class = "correction" title =
"spelling unchanged">Ar</ins> Rashid (786) certain curious tombs near
Bagdad with singular pyramidal roofs. The ruined mosque at Tabriz
(1300), and the beautiful domical <b>Tomb</b> at <b>Sultaniyeh</b>
(1313) belong to the Mogul period. They show all the essential features
of the later architecture of the Sufis
<span class = "pagenum">146</span>
<a name = "page146" id = "page146"> </a>
(1499&ndash;1694), during whose dynastic period were built the still
more splendid and more celebrated <b>Meidan</b> or square, the great
mosque of Mesjid Shah, the Bazaar and the College or Medress of Hussein
Shah, all at Ispahan, and many other important monuments at Ispahan,
Bagdad, and Teheran. In these structures four elements especially claim
attention; the pointed bulbous dome, the round minaret, the portal-arch
rising above the adjacent portions of the building, and the use of
enamelled terra-cotta tiles as an external decoration. To these may be
added the ogee arch (<i>ogee</i> = double-reversed curve), as an
occasional feature. The vaulting is most ingenious and beautiful, and
its forms, whether executed in brick or in plaster, are sufficiently
varied without resort to the perplexing complications of stalactite
work. In Persian decoration the most striking qualities are the harmony
of blended color, broken up into minute patterns and more subdued in
tone than in the Hispano-Moresque, and the preference of flowing lines
and floral ornament to the geometric puzzles of Arabic design. Persian
architecture influenced both Turkish and Indo-Moslem art, which owe to
it a large part of their decorative charm.</p>


<p><b>INDO-MOSLEM.</b> The Mohammedan architecture of India is so
distinct from all the native Indian styles and so related to the art of
Persia, if not to that of the Arabs, that it properly belongs here
rather than in the later chapter on Oriental styles. It was in the
eleventh century that the states of India first began to fall before
Mohammedan invaders, but not until the end of the fifteenth century that
the great Mogul dynasty was established in Hindostan as the dominant
power. During the intervening period local schools of Moslem
architecture were developing in the Pathan country of Northern India
(1193&ndash;1554), in Jaunpore and Gujerat (1396&ndash;1572), in Scinde,
where Persian influence predominated; in Kalburgah and Bidar
(1347&ndash;1426). These
<span class = "pagenum">147</span>
<a name = "page147" id = "page147"> </a>
schools differed considerably in spirit and detail; but under the Moguls
(1494&ndash;1706) there was less diversity, and to this dynasty we owe
many of the most magnificent mosques and tombs of India, among which
those of Bijapur retain a marked and distinct style of their own.</p>

FIG. 85.&mdash;TOMB OF MAHMUD, BIJAPUR. SECTION.</p>

<p>The Mohammedan monuments of India are characterized by a grandeur and
amplitude of disposition, a&nbsp;symmetry and monumental dignity of
design which distinguishes them widely from the picturesque but
sometimes trivial buildings of the Arabs and Moors. Less dependent on
color than the Moorish or Persian structures, they are usually built of
marble, or of marble and sandstone, giving them an air of permanence and
solidity wanting in other Moslem styles except the Turkish. The dome,
the round minaret, the pointed arch, and the colossal portal-arch, are
universal, as in Persia, and enamelled tiles are also used, but chiefly
for interior decoration. Externally the more dignified if less
resplendent decoration of surface carving is used, in patterns of minute
and graceful scrolls, leaf forms, and Arabic inscriptions covering large
surfaces. The Arabic stalactite pendentive star-panelling and
geometrical interlace are rarely if ever seen. The dome on the square
plan is almost universal, but neither the Byzantine nor the Arabic
pendentive is used, striking and original combinations of vaulting
surfaces, of corner squinches, of corbelling and ribs, being used in its
place. Many of the Pathan
<span class = "pagenum">148</span>
<a name = "page148" id = "page148"> </a>
domes and arches at Delhi, Ajmir, Ahmedabad, Shepree, etc., are built in
horizontal or corbelled courses supported on slender columns, and exert
no thrust at all, so that they are vaults only in form, like the dome of
the Tholos of Atreus (<a href = "#fig24">Fig.&nbsp;24</a>). The most
imposing and original of all Indian domes are those of the <b>Jumma
Musjid</b> and of the <b>Tomb of Mahmud</b>, both at Bijapur, the latter
137 feet in span (Fig. 85). These two monuments, indeed, with the Mogul
Taj Mahal at Agra, not only deserve the first rank among Indian
monuments, but in constructive science combined with noble proportions
and exquisite beauty are hardly, if at all, surpassed by the greatest
triumphs of western art. The Indo-Moslem architects, moreover,
especially those of the Mogul period, excelled in providing artistic
settings for their monuments. Immense platforms, superb courts, imposing
flights of steps, noble gateways, minarets to mark the angles of
enclosures, and landscape gardening of a high order, enhance greatly the
effect of the great mosques, tombs, and palaces of Agra, Delhi,
Futtehpore Sikhri, Allahabad, Secundra, etc.</p>

<p>The most notable monuments of the Moguls are the <b>Mosque of
Akbar</b> (1556&ndash;1605) at Futtehpore Sikhri, the tomb of that
sultan at Secundra, and his palace at Allahabad; the <b>Pearl Mosque</b>
at Agra and the <b>Jumma Musjid</b> at Delhi, one of the largest and
noblest of Indian mosques, both built by Shah Jehan about 1650; his
immense but now ruined palace in the same city; and finally the
unrivalled mausoleum, the <b>Taj Mahal</b> at Agra, built during his
lifetime as a festal hall, to serve as his tomb after death (Fig. 86).
This last is the pearl of Indian architecture, though it is said to have
been designed by a European architect, French or Italian. It is a white
marble structure 185 feet square, centred in a court 313 feet square,
forming a platform 18 feet high. The corners of this court are marked by
elegant minarets, and the whole is dominated by
<span class = "pagenum">149</span>
<a name = "page149" id = "page149"> </a>
the exquisite white marble dome, 58 feet in diameter, 80 feet high,
internally rising over four domical corner chapels, and covered
externally by a lofty marble bulb-dome on a high drum. The rich
materials, beautiful execution, and exquisite inlaying of this mausoleum
are worthy of its majestic design. On the whole, in the architecture of
the Moguls in Bijapur, Agra, and Delhi, Mohammedan architecture reaches
its highest expression in the totality and balance of its qualities of
construction, composition, detail, ornament, and settings. The later
monuments show the decline of the style, and though often rich and
imposing, are lacking in refinement and originality.</p>

<p><b>TURKISH.</b> The Ottoman Turks, who began their conquering career
under Osman&nbsp;I. in Bithynia in 1299, had for a
<span class = "pagenum">150</span>
<a name = "page150" id = "page150"> </a>
century been occupying the fairest portions of the Byzantine empire
when, in 1453, they became masters of Constantinople. Hagia Sophia was
at once occupied as their chief mosque, and such of the other churches
as were spared, were divided between the victors and the vanquished. The
conqueror, Mehmet II., at the same time set about the building of a new
mosque, entrusting the design to a Byzantine, Christodoulos, whom he
directed to reproduce, with some modifications, the design of the “Great
Church”&mdash;Hagia Sophia. The type thus officially adopted has ever
since remained the controlling model of Turkish mosque design, so far,
at least, as general plan and constructive principles are concerned.
Thus the conquering Turks, educated by a century of study and imitation
of Byzantine models in Brusa, Nicomedia, Smyrna, Adrianople, and other
cities earlier subjugated, did what the Byzantines had, during nine
centuries, failed to do. The noble idea first expressed by Anthemius and
Isidorus in the Church of Hagia Sophia had remained undeveloped,
unimitated by later architects. It was the Turk who first seized upon
its possibilities, and developed therefrom a style of architecture less
sumptuous in color and decoration than the sister styles of Persia,
Cairo, or India, but of great nobility and dignity, notwithstanding. The
low-curved dome with its crown of buttressed windows, the plain
spherical pendentives, the great apses at each end, covered by
half-domes and penetrated by smaller niches, the four massive piers with
their projecting buttress-masses extending across the broad lateral
aisles, the narthex and the arcaded atrium in front&mdash;all these
appear in the great Turkish mosques of Constantinople. In the
Conqueror’s mosque, however, two apses with half-domes replace the
lateral galleries and clearstory of Hagia Sophia, making a perfectly
quadripartite plan, destitute of the emphasis and significance of a plan
drawn on one main axis (Fig. 87).
<span class = "pagenum">151</span>
<a name = "page151" id = "page151"> </a>
The same treatment occurs in the mosque of Ahmed&nbsp;I., the
<b>Ahmediyeh</b> (1608; Fig. 88), and the <b>Yeni Djami</b> (“New
Mosque”) at the port (1665). In the mosque of <b>Osman III.</b> (1755)
the reverse change was effected; the mosque has no great apses, four
clearstories filling the four arches under the dome, as also in several
of the later and smaller mosques. The greatest and noblest of the
Turkish mosques, the <b>Suleimaniyeh</b>, built in 1553 by Soliman the
Magnificent, returned to the Byzantine combination of two half-domes
with two clearstories (Fig. 89).</p>

<p>In none of these monuments is there the internal magnificence of
marble and mosaic of the Byzantine churches. These are only in a measure
replaced by Persian tile-wainscoting and stained-glass windows of the
Arabic type. The division into stories and the treatment of scale are
less well managed than in the Hagia Sophia; on the other hand, the
proportion of height to width is generally admirable. The exterior
treatment is unique and effective, far superior to the Byzantine
practice. The massing of domes and half-domes and roofs is more
artistically arranged; and while there is little of that minute carved
detail found in Egypt and India, the composition of the lateral arcades,
the simple but impressive domical peristyles of the courts, and the
graceful forms of the pointed arches, with alternating voussoirs of
white and black marble, are artistic in a high degree. The minarets are,
however,
<span class = "pagenum">152</span>

inferior to those of Indian, Persian, and Arabic art, though graceful in

<p>Nearly all the great mosques are accompanied by the domical tombs
(<i>turbeh</i>) of their imperial founders. Some of these are of noble
size and great beauty of proportion and decoration. The <b>Tomb of
Roxelana</b> (Khourrem), the favorite wife of Soliman the Magnificent
(1553), is the most beautiful of all, and perhaps the most perfect gem
of Turkish architecture, with its elegant arcade surrounding the
octagonal domical mausoleum-chamber. The <b>monumental fountains</b> of
Constantinople also deserve mention. Of these, the one erected by Ahmet
III. (1710), near Hagia
<span class = "pagenum">153</span>
<a name = "page153" id = "page153"> </a>
Sophia, is the most beautiful. They usually consist of a rectangular
marble reservoir with pagoda-like roof and broad eaves, the four faces
of the fountain adorned each with a niche and basin, and covered with
relief carving and gilded inscriptions.</p>

<p><b>PALACES.</b> In this department the Turks have done little of
importance. The buildings in the Seraglio gardens are low and
insignificant. The <b>Tchinli Kiosque</b>, now the Imperial Museum, is
however, a&nbsp;simple but graceful two-storied edifice, consisting of
four vaulted chambers in the angles of a fine cruciform hall, with domes
treated like those of Bijapur on a small scale; the tiling and the
veranda in front are particularly elegant; the design suggests Persian
handiwork. The later palaces, designed by Armenians, are picturesque
white marble and stucco buildings on the water’s edge; they possess
richly decorated halls, but the details are of a debased European rococo
style, quite unworthy of an Oriental monarch.</p>

<p><b>EARLY MEDIÆVAL EUROPE.</b> The fall of the Western Empire in 476
<span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> marked the beginning of a new era
in architecture outside of the Byzantine Empire. The so-called Dark Ages
which followed this event constituted the formative period of the new
Western civilization, during which the Celtic and Germanic races were
being Christianized and subjected to the authority and to the educative
influences of the Church. Under these conditions a new architecture was
developed, founded upon the traditions of the early Christian builders,
modified in different regions by Roman or Byzantine influences. For Rome
recovered early her antique prestige, and Roman monuments covering the
soil of Southern Europe, were a constant
<span class = "pagenum">156</span>
<a name = "page156" id = "page156"> </a>
object lesson to the builders of that time. To this new architecture of
the West, which in the tenth and eleventh centuries first began to
achieve worthy and monumental results, the generic name of
<b>Romanesque</b> has been commonly given, in spite of the great
diversity of its manifestations in different countries.</p>


<p><b>CHARACTER OF THE ARCHITECTURE.</b> Romanesque architecture was
pre-eminently ecclesiastical. Civilization and culture emanated from the
Church, and her requirements and discipline gave form to the builder’s
art. But the basilican style, which had so well served her purposes in
the earlier centuries and on classic soil, was ill-suited to the new
conditions. Corinthian columns, marble incrustations, and splendid
mosaics were not to be had for the asking in the forests of Gaul or
Germany, nor could the Lombards and Ostrogoths in Italy or their
descendants reproduce them. The basilican style was complete in itself,
possessing no seeds of further growth. The priests and monks of Italy
and Western Europe sought to rear with unskilled labor churches of stone
in which the general dispositions of the basilica should reappear in
simpler, more massive dress, and, as far as possible, in a fireproof
construction with vaults of stone. This problem underlies all the varied
phases of Romanesque architecture; its final solution was not, however,
reached until the Gothic period, to which the Romanesque forms the
transition and stepping-stone.</p>

<p><b>MEDIÆVAL ITALY.</b> Italy in the Dark Ages stood midway between
the civilization of the Eastern Empire and the semi-barbarism of the
West. Rome, Ravenna, and Venice early became centres of culture and
maintained continuous commercial relations with the East. Architecture
did not lack either the inspiration or the means for advancing on new
lines. But its advance was by no means the same everywhere. The unifying
influence of the church was
<span class = "pagenum">157</span>
<a name = "page157" id = "page157"> </a>
counterbalanced by the provincialism and the local diversities of the
various Italian states, resulting in a wide variety of styles. These,
however, may be broadly grouped in four divisions: the <b>Lombard</b>,
the <b>Tuscan-Romanesque</b>, the <b>Italo-Byzantine</b>, and the
unchanged <b>Basilican</b> or Early Christian, which last, as was shown
in Chapter&nbsp;X., continued to be practised in Rome throughout the
Middle Ages.</p>

<p><b>LOMBARD STYLE.</b> Owing to the general rebuilding of ancient
churches under the more settled social conditions of the eleventh and
twelfth centuries, little remains to us of the architecture of the three
preceding centuries in Italy, except the Roman basilicas and a few
baptisteries and circular churches, already mentioned in Chapter&nbsp;X.
The so-called Lombard monuments belong mainly to the eleventh and
twelfth centuries. They are found not only in Lombardy, but also in
Venetia and the Æmilia. Milan, Pavia, Piacenza, Bologna, and Verona were
important centres of development of this style. The churches were nearly
all vaulted, but the plans were basilican, with such variations
<span class = "pagenum">158</span>
<a name = "page158" id = "page158"> </a>
as resulted from efforts to meet the exigencies of vaulted construction.
The nave was narrowed, and instead of rows of columns carrying a thin
clearstory wall, a&nbsp;few massive piers of masonry, connected by broad
pier-arches, supported the heavy ribs of the groined vaulting, as in
S.&nbsp;Ambrogio, Milan (Fig. 90). To resist the thrust of the main
vault, the clearstory was sometimes suppressed, the side aisle carried
up in two stories forming galleries, and rows of chapels added at the
sides, their partitions forming buttresses. The piers were often of
clustered section, the better to receive the various arches and ribs
they supported. The vaulting was in square divisions or
<i>vaulting-bays</i>, each embracing two pier-arches which met upon an
intermediate pier lighter than the others. Thus the whole aspect of the
interior was revolutionized. The lightness, spaciousness, and decorative
elegance of the basilicas were here exchanged for a sombre and massive
dignity severe in its plainness. The Choir was sometimes raised a few
feet above the nave, to allow of a crypt and <i>confessio</i> beneath,
reached by broad flights of steps from the nave. Sta.<!-- invisible .

Maria della Pieve at Arezzo (9th-11th century), <b>S.&nbsp;Michele</b>
at Pavia (late 11th century), the <b>Cathedral of Piacenza</b> (1122),
<b>S.&nbsp;Ambrogio</b> at Milan (12th century), and <b>S.&nbsp;Zeno</b>
at Verona (1139) are notable monuments of this style.</p>


<p><b>LOMBARD EXTERIORS.</b> The few architectural embellishments
employed on the simple exteriors of the Lombard churches were usually
effective and well composed. Slender columnettes or long pilasters,
blind arcades, and open arcaded galleries under the eaves gave light and
shade to these exteriors. The façades were mere frontispieces with a
single broad gable, the three aisles of the church being merely
suggested by flat or round pilasters dividing the front (Fig 91). Gabled
porches, with columns resting on the backs of lions or monsters, adorned
the doorways. The carving was often of a fierce and grotesque character.
Detached bell-towers or <i>campaniles</i> adjoined many of these
churches; square and simple in mass, but with well-distributed openings
and well-proportioned belfries (Piacenza S.&nbsp;Zeno at Verona,
etc.).<a class = "tag" name = "tag18" id = "tag18" href =
"#note18">18</a></p>


<p><b>THE TUSCAN ROMANESQUE.</b> The churches of this style (sometimes
called the <b>Pisan</b>) were less vigorous but more elegant and
artistic in design than the Lombard. They were basilicas in plan, with
timber ceilings and high clearstories on columnar arcades. In their
decoration, both internal and external, they betray the influence of
Byzantine traditions, especially in the use of white and colored marble
in alternating bands or in panelled veneering. Still more striking is
the external decorative application of wall-arcades, sometimes occupying
the whole height of the wall and carried on flat pilasters, sometimes in
superposed stages of small arches on slender columns standing free of
the wall. In general the decorative element prevailed over the
constructive in the design of these picturesquely beautiful churches,
some of which are of noble size. The <b>Duomo</b> (cathedral) of
<b>Pisa</b>, built 1063&ndash;1118, is the finest monument
<span class = "pagenum">160</span>
<a name = "page160" id = "page160"> </a>
of the style (Figs. 92, 93). It is 312 feet long and 118 wide, with long
transepts and an elliptical dome of later date over the <i>crossing</i>
(the intersection of nave and transepts). Its richly arcaded front and
banded flanks strikingly exemplify the illogical and unconstructive but
highly decorative methods of the Tuscan Romanesque builders. The
circular <b>Baptistery</b> (1153), with its lofty domical central hall
surrounded by an aisle, an imposing development of the type established
by Constantine (<a href = "#page111">p.&nbsp;111</a>), and the famous
<b>Leaning Tower</b> (1174), both designed with external arcading,
combine with the Duomo to form the most remarkable group of
ecclesiastical buildings in Italy, if not in Europe (Fig.&nbsp;92).</p>

<p>The same style appears in more flamboyant shape in

<a name = "page161" id = "page161"> </a>
some of the churches of Lucca. The cathedral <b>S.&nbsp;Martino</b>

and largest of these; <b>S.&nbsp;Michele</b> (façade, 1288) and
S.&nbsp;Frediano (twelfth century) have the most elaborately decorated
façades. The same principles of design appear in the cathedral and
several other churches in Pistoia and Prato; but these belong, for the
most part, to the Gothic period.</p>

FIG. 93.&mdash;INTERIOR OF PISA CATHEDRAL.</p>


<p><b>FLORENCE.</b> The church of <b>S. Miniato</b>, in the suburbs of
Florence, is a beautiful example of a modification of the Pisan style.
It is in plan a basilica with two piers interrupting the colonnade on
each side of the nave and supporting powerful transverse arches. The
interior is embellished with bands and patterns in black and white, and
the woodwork of the open-timber roof is elegantly decorated with fine
patterns in red, green, blue, and gold&mdash;a&nbsp;treatment common in
early mediæval churches, as at Messina, Orvieto, etc. The exterior is
adorned with wall-arches of
<span class = "pagenum">162</span>
<a name = "page162" id = "page162"> </a>
classic design and with panelled veneering in white and dark marble,
instead of the horizontal bands of the Pisan churches. This system of
external decoration, a&nbsp;blending of Pisan and Italo-Byzantine
methods, became the established practice in Florence, lasting through
the whole Gothic period. The <b>Baptistery</b> of Florence, originally
the cathedral, an imposing polygonal domical edifice of the tenth
century, presents externally one of the most admirable examples of this
practice. Its marble veneering in black and white, with pilasters and
arches of excellent design, is attributed by Vasari to Arnolfo di
Cambio, but is by many considered to be much older, although restored by
that architect in 1294.</p>

<p>Suggestions of the Pisan arcade system are found in widely scattered
examples in the east and south of Italy, mingled with features of
Lombard and Byzantine design. In Apulia, as at Bari, Caserta Vecchia
(1100), Molfetta (1192), and in Sicily, the Byzantine influence is
conspicuous in the use of domes and in many of the decorative details.
Particularly is this the case at Palermo and Monreale, where the
churches erected after the Norman conquest&mdash;some of them domical,
some basilican&mdash;show a strange but picturesque and beautiful
mixture of Romanesque, Byzantine, and Arabic forms. The <b>Cathedral</b>
of <b>Monreale</b> and the churches of the <b>Eremiti</b> and <b>La
Martorana</b> at Palermo are the most important.</p>

<p>The <b>Italo-Byzantine</b> style has already found mention in the
latter part of Chapter XI. Venice and Ravenna were its chief centres;
while the influence, both of the parent style and of its Italian
offshoot was, as we have just shown, very widespread.</p>


<p><b>WESTERN ROMANESQUE ARCHITECTURE.</b> In Western Europe the unrest
and lawlessness which attended the unsettled relations of society under
the feudal system long retarded the establishment of that social order
without
<span class = "pagenum">163</span>
<a name = "page163" id = "page163"> </a>
which architectural progress is impossible. With the eleventh century
there began, however, a&nbsp;great activity in building, principally
among the monasteries, which represented all that there was of culture
and stability amid the prevailing disorder. Undisturbed by war, the only
abodes of peaceful labor, learning, and piety, they had become rich and
powerful, both in men and land. Probably the more or less general
apprehension of the supposed impending end of the world in the year 1000
contributed to this result by driving unquiet consciences to seek refuge
in the monasteries, or to endow them richly.</p>

<p>The monastic builders, with little technical training, but with
plenty of willing hands, sought out new architectural paths to meet
their special needs. Remote from classic and Byzantine models, and
mainly dependent on their own resources, they often failed to realize
the intended results. But skill came with experience, and with advancing
civilization and a surer mastery of construction came a finer taste and
greater elegance of design. Meanwhile military architecture developed a
new science of building, and covered Europe with imposing castles,
admirably constructed and often artistic in design as far as military
exigencies would permit.</p>


<p><b>CHARACTER OF THE STYLE.</b> The Romanesque architecture of the
eleventh and twelfth centuries in Western Europe (sometimes called the
<b>Round-Arched Gothic</b>) was thus predominantly though not
exclusively monastic. This gave it a certain unity of character in spite
of national and local variations. The problem which the wealthy orders
set themselves was, like that of the Lombard church-builders in Italy,
to adapt the basilica plan to the exigencies of vaulted construction.
Massive walls, round arches stepped or recessed to lighten their
appearance, heavy mouldings richly carved, clustered piers and
jamb-shafts, capitals either of the <i>cushion</i> type or imitated from
the Corinthian,
<span class = "pagenum">164</span>
<a name = "page164" id = "page164"> </a>
and strong and effective carving&mdash;all these are features alike of
French, German, English, and Spanish Romanesque architecture.</p>

<p><b>THE FRENCH ROMANESQUE.</b> Though monasticism produced remarkable
results in France, architecture there did not wholly depend upon the
monasteries. Southern Gaul (Provence) was full of classic remains and
classic traditions while at the same time it maintained close trade
relations with Venice and the East.<a class = "tag" name = "tag19" id =
"tag19" href = "#note19">19</a> The church of <b>St. Front</b> at
Perigueux, built in 1120, reproduced the plan of St. Mark’s with
singular fidelity, but without its rich decoration, and with pointed
instead of round arches (Figs. 94, 95). The domical cathedral of
<b>Cahors</b> (1050&ndash;1100), an obvious imitation of S.&nbsp;Irene
at Constantinople, and the later and more Gothic Cathedral of
<b>Angoulême</b> display a notable advance in architectural skill
outside of the monasteries. Among the abbeys, <b>Fontevrault</b>
(1101&ndash;1119) closely resembles Angoulême, but surpasses it in the
elegance of its choir and chapels. In these and a number of other
domical churches of the same Franco-Byzantine type in Aquitania, the
substitution of the Latin cross in the plan for the Greek cross used in
St. Front, evinces the Gallic tendency to work out to their logical end
new ideas or new applications of old ones. These striking variations on
Byzantine themes might have developed into an independent local style
but for the overwhelming
<span class = "pagenum">165</span>

tide of Gothic influence which later poured in from the North.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, farther south (at Arles, Avignon, etc.), classic models
strongly influenced the details, if not the plans, of an interesting
series of churches remarkable especially for their porches rich with
figure sculpture and for their elaborately carved details. The classic
archivolt, the Corinthian capital, the Roman forms of enriched
mouldings, are evident at a glance in the porches of Notre Dame des Doms
at Avignon, of the church of St. Gilles, and of St. Trophime at
Arles.</p>

<p><b>DEVELOPMENT OF VAULTING.</b> It was in Central France, and mainly
along the Loire, that the systematic development of vaulted church
architecture began. Naves covered with barrel-vaults appear in a number
of large churches built during the eleventh and twelfth centuries, with
apsidal and transeptal chapels and aisles carried around the apse, as in
St. Etienne, Nevers, <b>Notre Dame du Port</b> at Clermont-Ferrand (Fig.
96), and <b>St. Paul</b> at Issoire. The thrust of these ponderous
vaults was clumsily resisted by half-barrel vaults over the side-aisles,
transmitting the strain to massive side-walls (Fig. 97), or by high
side-aisles with transverse barrel or groined vaults over each bay. In
either case the clearstory was suppressed&mdash;a&nbsp;fact which
mattered
<span class = "pagenum">166</span>
<a name = "page166" id = "page166"> </a>
little in the sunny southern provinces. In the more cloudy North, in
Normandy, Picardy, and the Royal Domain, the nave-vault was raised
higher to admit of clearstory windows, and its section was in some cases
made like a pointed arch, to diminish its thrust, as at <b>Autun</b>.
But these eleventh-century vaults nearly all fell in, and had to be
reconstructed on new principles. In this work the Clunisians seem to
have led the way, as at <b>Cluny</b> (1089) and <b>Vézelay</b> (1100).
In the latter church, one of the finest and most interesting French
edifices of the twelfth century, a&nbsp;groined vault replaced the
barrel-vault, though the oblong plan of the vaulting-bays, due to the
nave being wider than the pier-arches, led to somewhat awkward twisted
surfaces in the vaulting. But even here the vaults had insufficient
lateral buttressing, and began to crack and settle; so that in the great
ante-chapel, built thirty years later, the side-aisles were made in two
stories, the better to resist the thrust, and the groined vaults
themselves were constructed of pointed section. These seem to be the
earliest pointed groined vaults in France. It was not till the second
half of that century, however (1150&ndash;1200), that the flying
buttress was combined with such vaults, so as to permit of high
clearstories for the better lighting of the nave; and
<span class = "pagenum">167</span>
<a name = "page167" id = "page167"> </a>
the problem of satisfactorily vaulting an oblong space with a groined
vault was not solved until the following century.</p>

<p><b>ONE-AISLED CHURCHES.</b> In the Franco-Byzantine churches already
described (<a href = "#page164">p.&nbsp;164</a>) this difficulty of the
oblong vaulting-bay did not occur, owing to the absence of side-aisles
and pier-arches. Following this conception of church-planning,
a&nbsp;number of interesting parish churches and a few cathedrals were
built in various parts of France in which side-recesses or chapels took
the place of side-aisles. The partitions separating them served as
abutments for the groined or barrel-vaults of the nave. The cathedrals
of <b>Autun</b> (1150) and <b>Langres</b> (1160), and in the fourteenth
century that of Alby, employed this arrangement, common in many earlier
Provençal churches which have disappeared.</p>

<p><b>SIX-PART VAULTING.</b> In the Royal Domain great architectural
activity does not appear to have begun until the beginning of the Gothic
period in the middle of the twelfth century. But in Normandy, and
especially at Caen and Mont St. Michel, there were produced, between
1046 and 1120, some remarkable churches, in which a high clearstory was
secured in conjunction with a vaulted nave, by the use of “six-part”
vaulting (Fig. 98). This was an awkward expedient, by which a square
vaulting-bay was divided into six parts by the groins and by a middle
transverse rib, necessitating two narrow skew vaults meeting at
<span class = "pagenum">168</span>
<a name = "page168" id = "page168"> </a>
the centre. This unsatisfactory device was retained for over a century,
and was common in early Gothic churches both in France and Great
Britain. It made it possible to resist the thrust by high side-aisles,
and yet to open windows above these under the cross-vaults. The abbey
churches of <b>St. Etienne</b> (the Abbaye aux Hommes) and <b>Ste.
Trinité</b> (Abbaye aux Dames), at Caen, built in the time of William
the Conqueror, were among the most magnificent churches of their time,
both in size and in the excellence and ingenuity of their construction.
The great abbey church of <b>Mont St. Michel</b> (much altered in later
times) should also be mentioned here. At the same time these and other
Norman churches showed a great advance in their internal composition.
A&nbsp;well-developed triforium or subordinate gallery was introduced
between the pier-arches and clearstory, and all the structural membering
of the edifice was better proportioned and more logically expressed than
in most contemporary work.</p>


<p><b>ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS.</b> The details of French Romanesque
architecture varied considerably in the several provinces, according as
classic, Byzantine, or local influences prevailed. Except in a few of
the Aquitanian churches, the round arch was universal. The walls were
heavy and built of rubble between facings of stones of moderate size
dressed with the axe. Windows and doors were widely splayed to diminish
the obstruction of the massive walls, and were treated with jamb-shafts
and recessed arches. These were usually formed with large cylindrical
mouldings, richly carved with leaf ornaments, zigzags, billets, and
grotesques. Figure-sculpture was more generally used in the South than
in the North. The interior piers were sometimes cylindrical, but more
often clustered, and where square bays of four-part or six-part vaulting
were employed, the piers were alternately lighter and heavier. Each
shaft had its independent capital either of the block type or of a form
<span class = "pagenum">169</span>
<a name = "page169" id = "page169"> </a>
resembling somewhat that of the Corinthian order. During the eleventh
century it became customary to carry up to the main vaulting one or more
shafts of the compound pier to support the vaulting ribs. Thus the
division of the nave into <i>bays</i> was accentuated, while at the same
time the horizontal three-fold division of the height by a well-defined
triforium between the pier-arches and clearstory began to be likewise
emphasized.</p>


<p><b>VAULTING.</b> The vaulting was also divided into bays by
transverse ribs, and where it was groined the groins themselves began in
the twelfth century to be marked by groin-ribs. These were constructed
independently of the vaulting, and the four or six compartments of each
vaulting-bay were then built in, the ribs serving, in part at least, to
support the centrings for this purpose. This far-reaching principle,
already applied by the Romans in their concrete vaults (see <a href =
"#page84">p.&nbsp;84</a>), appears as a re-discovery, or rather an
independent invention, of the builders of Normandy at the close of the
eleventh century. The flying buttress was a later invention; in the
round-arched buildings of the eleventh and twelfth centuries the
buttressing was mainly internal, and was incomplete and timid in its
arrangement.</p>


<p><b>EXTERIORS.</b> The exteriors were on this account plain and flat.
The windows were small, the mouldings simple, and towers were rarely
combined with the body of the church until after the beginning of the
twelfth century. Then they appeared as mere belfries of moderate height,
with pyramidal roofs and effectively arranged openings, the germs of the
noble Gothic spires of later times. Externally the western porches and
portals were the most important features of the design, producing an
imposing effect by their massive arches, clustered piers, richly carved
mouldings, and deep shadows.</p>


<p><b>CLOISTERS, ETC.</b> Mention should be made of the other monastic
buildings which were grouped around the abbey
<span class = "pagenum">170</span>
<a name = "page170" id = "page170"> </a>
churches of this period. These comprised refectories, chapter-halls,
cloistered courts surrounded by the conventual cells, and a large number
of accessory structures for kitchens, infirmaries, stores, etc. The
whole formed an elaborate and complex aggregation of connected
buildings, often of great size and beauty, especially the refectories
and cloisters. Most of these conventual buildings have disappeared, many
of them having been demolished during the Gothic period to make way for
more elegant structures in the new style. There remain, however,
a&nbsp;number of fine cloistered courts in their original form,
especially in Southern France. Among the most remarkable of these are
those of <b>Moissac</b>, <b>Elne</b>, and <b>Montmajour</b>.</p>

<p><b>MEDIÆVAL GERMANY.</b> Architecture developed less rapidly and
symmetrically in Germany than in France, notwithstanding the strong
centralized government of the empire. The early churches were of wood,
and the substitution of stone for wood proceeded slowly. During the
Carolingian epoch (800&ndash;919), however, a&nbsp;few important
buildings were erected, embodying Byzantine and classic traditions.
Among these the most notable was the <b>Minster</b> or palatine chapel
of Charlemagne at <b>Aix-la-Chapelle</b>, an obvious imitation of San
Vitale at Ravenna. It consisted of an octagonal domed hall surrounded by
a vaulted aisle in two stories, but without the eight niches of the
Ravenna plan. It was preceded by a porch flanked by turrets. The
Byzantine type thus introduced was repeated in later churches, as in the
Nuns’ Choir at Essen (947) and at Ottmarsheim (1050). In the great
monastery at Fulda a basilica with
<span class = "pagenum">173</span>
<a name = "page173" id = "page173"> </a>
transepts and with an apsidal choir at either end was built in 803.
These choirs were raised above the level of the nave, to admit of crypts
beneath them, as in many Lombard churches; a&nbsp;practice which, with
the reduplication of the choir and apse just mentioned, became very
common in German Romanesque architecture.</p>


<p><b>EARLY CHURCHES.</b> It was in Saxony that this architecture first
entered upon a truly national development. The early churches of this
province and of Hildesheim (where architecture flourished under the
favor of the bishops, as elsewhere under the royal influence) were of
basilican plan and destitute of vaulting, except in the crypts. They
were built with massive piers, sometimes rectangular, sometimes
clustered, the two kinds often alternating in the same nave. Short
columns were, however, sometimes used instead of piers, either alone, as
at Paulinzelle and Limburg-on-the-Hardt (1024&ndash;39), or alternating
with piers, as at Hecklingen, <b>Gernrode</b> (958&ndash;1050), and
<b>St. Godehard</b> at Hildesheim (1133). A&nbsp;triple eastern apse,
with apsidal chapels projecting eastward from the transepts, were common
elements in the plans, and a second apse, choir, and crypt at the west
end were not infrequent. Externally the most striking feature was the
association of two, four, or even six square or circular towers with the
mass of the church, and the elevation of square or polygonal turrets or
cupolas over the crossing. These adjuncts gave a very picturesque aspect
to edifices otherwise somewhat wanting in artistic interest.</p>

<p><b>RHENISH CHURCHES.</b> It was in the Rhine provinces that vaulting

after its general adoption in France. Cologne possesses an

interesting trio of churches in which the Byzantine dome on squinches or
on pendentives, with three apses or niches opening into the central
area, was associated with a long three aisled nave (<b>St.
Mary-in-the-Capitol</b>, begun in 9th century; <b>Great St.
Martin’s</b>, 1150&ndash;70; <b>Apostles’ Church</b>, 1160&ndash;99: the
naves vaulted later). The double chapel at <b>Schwarz-Rheindorf</b>,
near Bonn (1151), also has the crossing covered by a dome on
pendentives.</p>

FIG. 100.&mdash;ONE BAY OF CATHEDRAL AT SPIRES.</p>

<p>The vaulting of the nave itself was developed in another series of
edifices of imposing size, the cathedrals of <b>Mayence</b> (1036),
<b>Spires</b> (Speyer), and <b>Worms</b>, and the <b>Abbey of Laach</b>,
all built in the 11th century and vaulted early in the 12th. In the
first three the main vaulting is in square bays, each covering two bays
of the nave, the piers of which are alternately lighter and heavier
(Figs. 99, 100). At Laach the vaulting-bays are oblong, both in nave and
aisles. There was no triforium gallery, and stability was secured only
by excessive thickness in the piers and clearstory walls, and by
bringing down the main vault as near to the side-aisle roofs as
possible.</p>


<p><b>RHENISH EXTERIORS.</b> These great churches, together with those
of <b>Bonn</b> and <b>Limburg-on-the-Lahn</b> and the cathedral of
<b>Treves</b> (Trier, 1047), are interesting, not only by their size and
dignity of plan and the somewhat rude massiveness of their construction,
but even more so by the picturesqueness
<span class = "pagenum">175</span>
<a name = "page175" id = "page175"> </a>
of their external design (Fig. 101). Especially successful is the
massing of the large and small turrets with the lofty nave-roof and with
the apses at one or both ends. The systematic use of arcading to
decorate the exterior walls, and the introduction of open arcaded dwarf
galleries under the cornices of the apses, gables, and dome-turrets,
gave to these Rhenish churches an external beauty hardly equalled in
other contemporary edifices. This method of exterior design, and the
system of vaulting in square bays over double bays of the nave, were
probably derived from the Lombard churches of Northern Italy, with which
the <ins class = "correction" title = "spelling unchanged">Hohenstauffen</ins> emperors had many political
relations.</p>

<p>The Italian influence is also encountered in a number of circular
churches of early date, as at Fulda (9th-11th century), Drügelte, Bonn
(baptistery, demolished), and in façades like that at Rosheim, which is
a copy in little of San Zeno at Verona.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Germany architecture was in a backward state, especially
in the southern provinces. Outside of Saxony, Franconia, and the Rhine
provinces, very few works of importance were erected until the
thirteenth century.</p>

<p><b>SECULAR ARCHITECTURE.</b> Little remains to us of the secular
architecture of this period in Germany, if we except the great feudal
castles, especially those of the Rhine, which were, after all, rather
works of military engineering than of architectural art. The palace of
Charlemagne at Aix (the chapel of which was mentioned on <a href =
"#page172">p.&nbsp;172</a>) is known to have been a vast and splendid
group of buildings, partly, at least of marble; but hardly a vestige of
it remains. Of the extensive <b>Palace of Henry III.</b> at
<b>Goslar</b> there remain well-defined ruins of an imposing hall of
assembly in two aisles with triple-arched windows. At Brunswick the east
wing of the <b>Burg Dankwargerode</b> displays, in spite of modern
alterations, the arrangement of the chapel, great hall, two fortified
towers, and part of the residence of Henry the Lion. The <b>Wartburg</b>
palace (Ludwig III., <i>cir.</i> 1150) is more generally
known&mdash;a&nbsp;rectangular hall in three stories, with windows
effectively grouped to form arcades; while at Gelnhausen and Münzenberg
are ruins of somewhat similar buildings. A&nbsp;few of the Romanesque
monasteries of Germany have left partial remains, as at
<b>Maulbronn</b>, which was almost entirely rebuilt in the Gothic
period, and isolated buildings in Cologne and elsewhere. There remain
also in Cologne a number of Romanesque private houses with coupled
windows and stepped gables.</p>

The few extant remains of Saxon and Celtic buildings reveal a singular
poverty of ideas and want of technical skill. These scanty remains are
mostly of towers (those in Ireland nearly all round and tapering, with
conical tops, their use and date being the subjects of much controversy)
and crypts. The tower of Earl’s Barton is the most important and best
preserved of those in England. With the Norman conquest, however, began
an extraordinary activity in the building of churches and abbeys.
<span class = "pagenum">177</span>

William the Conqueror himself founded a number of these, and his Norman
ecclesiastics endeavored to surpass on British soil the contemporary
churches of Normandy. The new churches differed somewhat from their
French prototypes; they were narrower and lower, but much longer,
especially as to the choir and transepts. The cathedrals of
<b>Durham</b> (1096&ndash;1133) and <b>Norwich</b> (same date) are
important examples (Fig. 102). They also differed from the French
churches in two important particulars externally; a&nbsp;huge tower rose
usually over the crossing, and the western portals were small and
insignificant. Lateral entrances near the west end were given greater
importance and called <i>Galilees</i>. At Durham a Galilee chapel (not
shown in the plan), takes the place of a porch at the west end, like the
ante-churches of St. Benoît-sur-Loire and Vézelay.</p>


<p><b>THE NORMAN STYLE.</b> The Anglo-Norman builders employed the same
general features as the Romanesque builders of Normandy, but with more
of picturesqueness and less of refinement and technical elegance. Heavy
walls, recessed arches, round mouldings, cubic cushion-caps, clustered
piers, and in doorways a jamb-shaft for each stepping of the arch were
common to both styles. But in England the Corinthian form of capital is
rare, its place being taken by simpler forms.</p>

<p><b>NORMAN INTERIORS.</b> The interior design of the larger churches
of this period shows a close general analogy to
<span class = "pagenum">178</span>
<a name = "page178" id = "page178"> </a>
contemporaneous French Norman churches, as appears by comparing the nave
of Waltham or Peterboro’ with that of Cérisy-la-Forêt, in Normandy.
Although the massiveness of the Anglo-Norman piers and walls plainly
suggests the intention of vaulting the nave, this intention seems never
to have been carried out except in small churches and crypts. All the
existing abbeys and cathedrals of this period had wooden ceilings or
were, like Durham, Norwich, and Gloucester, vaulted at a later date.
Completed as they were with wooden nave-roofs, the clearstory was,
without danger, made quite lofty and furnished with windows of
considerable size. These were placed near the outside of the thick wall,
and a passage was left between them and a triple arch on the inner face
of the wall&mdash;a&nbsp;device imitated from the abbeys at Caen. The
vaulted side-aisles were low, with disproportionately wide pier-arches,
above which was a high triforium gallery under the side-roofs. Thus a
nearly equal height was assigned to each of the three stories of the
bay, disregarding that subordination of minor to major parts which gives
interest to an architectural composition. The piers were quite often
round, as at Gloucester, Hereford, and Bristol. Sometimes round piers
alternated with clustered piers, as at Durham and Waltham; and in some
cases clustered piers alone were employed, as at Peterboro’ and in the
transepts of Winchester (Fig. 103).</p>

<p><b>FAÇADES AND DOORWAYS.</b> All the details were of the simplest
character, except in the doorways. These were richly adorned with
clustered jamb-shafts and elaborately carved
<span class = "pagenum">179</span>
<a name = "page179" id = "page179"> </a>
mouldings, but there was little variety in the details of this carving.
The zigzag was the most common feature, though birds’ heads with the
beaks pointing toward the centre of the arch were not uncommon. In the
smaller churches (Fig. 104) the doorways were better proportioned to the
whole façade than in the larger ones, in which they appear as relatively
insignificant features. Very few examples remain of important Norman
façades in their original form, nearly all of these having been altered
after the round arch was displaced by the pointed arch in the latter
part of the twelfth century. Iffley church (Fig. 104) is a good example
of the style.</p>


<p><b>SPAIN.</b> During the Romanesque period a large part of Spain was
under Moorish dominion. The capture of Toledo, in 1062, by the
Christians, began the gradual emancipation of the country from Moslem
rule, and in the northern provinces a number of important churches were
erected under the influence of French Romanesque models. The use of
domical pendentives (as in the <b>Panteon</b> of <b>S.&nbsp;Isidoro</b>,
at Leon, and in the <i>cimborio</i> or dome over the choir at the
intersection of nave and transepts in old Salamanca cathedral) was
probably derived from the domical churches of Aquitania and Anjou.
Elsewhere the northern Romanesque type prevailed under various
modifications, with long nave and transepts, a&nbsp;short choir, and a
<span class = "pagenum">180</span>
<a name = "page180" id = "page180"> </a>
complete <i>chevet</i> with apsidal chapels. The church of <b>St.
Iago</b> at Compostella (1078) is the finest example of this class.
These churches nearly all had groined vaulting over the side-aisles and
barrel-vaults over the nave, the constructive system being substantially
that of the churches of Auvergne and the Loire Valley (<a href =
"#page165">p.&nbsp;165</a>). They differed, however, in the treatment of
the crossing of nave and transepts, over which was usually erected a
dome or cupola or pendentives or squinches, covered externally by an
imposing square lantern or tower, as in the <b>Old Cathedral</b> at
<b>Salamanca</b>, already mentioned (1120&ndash;78) and the
<b>Collegiate Church</b> at <b>Toro</b>. Occasional exceptions to these
types are met with, as in the basilican wooden-roofed church of
S.&nbsp;Millan at Segovia; in <b>S.&nbsp;Isidoro</b> at Leon, with
chapels and a later-added square eastern end, and the circular church of
the Templars at Segovia.</p>

<p>The architectural details of these Spanish churches did not differ
radically from contemporary French work. As in France and England, the
doorways were the most ornate parts of the design, the mouldings being
carved with extreme richness and the jambs frequently adorned with
statues, as in <b>S.&nbsp;Vincente</b> at Avila. There was no such
logical and reasoned-out system of external design as in France, and
there is consequently greater variety in the façades. Perhaps the most
remarkable thing about the architecture of this period is its apparent
exemption from the influence of the Moorish monuments which abounded on
every hand. This may be explained by the hatred which was felt by the
Christians for the Moslems and all their works.</p>

<p><b>INTRODUCTORY.</b> The architectural styles which were developed in
Western Europe during the period extending from about 1150 to 1450 or
1500, received in an unscientific age the wholly erroneous and inept
name of Gothic. This name has, however, become so fixed in common usage
that it is hardly possible to substitute for it any more scientific
designation. In reality the architecture to which it is applied was
nothing more than the sequel and outgrowth of the Romanesque, which we
have already studied. Its fundamental principles were the same; it was
concerned with the same problems. These it took up where the Romanesque
builders left them, and worked out their solution under new conditions,
until it had developed out of the simple and massive models of the early
twelfth century the splendid cathedrals of the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries in England, France, Germany, the Low Countries and Spain.</p>


<p><b>THE CHURCH AND ARCHITECTURE.</b> The twelfth century was an era of
transition in society, as in architecture. The ideas of Church and State
were becoming more clearly defined in the common mind. In the conflict
between feudalism
<span class = "pagenum">183</span>
<a name = "page183" id = "page183"> </a>
and royalty the monarchy was steadily gaining ground. The problem of
human right was beginning to present itself alongside of the problem of
human might. The relations between the crown, the feudal barons, the
pope, bishops, and abbots, differed widely in France, Germany, England,
and other countries. The struggle among them for supremacy presented
itself, therefore, in varied aspects; but the general outcome was
essentially the same. The church began to appear as something behind and
above abbots, bishops, kings, and barons. The supremacy of the papal
authority gained increasing recognition, and the episcopacy began to
overshadow the monastic institutions; the bishops appearing generally,
but especially in France, as the champions of popular rights. The
prerogatives of the crown became more firmly established, and thus the
Church and the State emerged from the social confusion as the two
institutions divinely appointed for the government of men.</p>

FIG. 105.&mdash;CONSTRUCTIVE SYSTEM OF GOTHIC CHURCH,<br>
ILLUSTRATING PRINCIPLES OF ISOLATED SUPPORTS AND BUTTRESSING.</p>

<p>Under these influences ecclesiastical architecture advanced with
rapid strides. No longer hampered by monastic restrictions, it called
into its service the laity, whose guilds of masons and builders carried
from one diocese to another their constantly increasing stores of
constructive
<span class = "pagenum">184</span>
<a name = "page184" id = "page184"> </a>
knowledge. By a wise division of labor, each man wrought only such parts
as he was specially trained to undertake. The
master-builder&mdash;bishop, abbot, or mason&mdash;seems to have planned
only the general arrangement and scheme of the building, leaving the
precise form of each detail to be determined as the work advanced,
according to the skill and fancy of the artisan to whom it was
intrusted. Thus was produced that remarkable variety in unity of the
Gothic cathedrals; thus, also, those singular irregularities and
makeshifts, those discrepancies and alterations in the design, which are
found in every great work of mediæval architecture. Gothic architecture
was constantly changing, attacking new problems or devising new
solutions of old ones. In this character of constant flux and
development it contrasts strongly with the classic styles, in which the
scheme and the principles were easily fixed and remained substantially
unchanged for centuries.</p>

FIG. 106.&mdash;PLAN OF SAINTE CHAPELLE, PARIS, SHOWING SUPPRESSION OF
SIDE-WALLS.</p>

<p><b>STRUCTURAL PRINCIPLES.</b> The pointed arch, so commonly regarded
as the most characteristic feature of the Gothic styles, was merely an
incidental feature of their development. What really distinguished them
most strikingly was the systematic application of two principles which
the Roman and Byzantine builders had recognized and applied, but which
seem to have been afterward forgotten until they were revived by the
later Romanesque architects. The first of these was the <i>concentration
of strains</i> upon isolated points of support, made possible by the
substitution
<span class = "pagenum">185</span>
<a name = "page185" id = "page185"> </a>
of groined for barrel vaults. This led to a corresponding concentration
of the masses of masonry at these points; the building was constructed
as if upon legs (Fig. 105). The wall became a mere filling-in between
the piers or buttresses, and in time was, indeed, practically
suppressed, immense windows filled with stained glass taking its place.
This is well illustrated in the <b>Sainte Chapelle</b> at Paris, built
1242&ndash;47 (Figs. 106, <a href = "#fig122">122</a>). In this
remarkable edifice, a&nbsp;series of groined vaults spring from slender
shafts built against deep buttresses which receive and resist all the
thrusts. The wall-spaces between them are wholly occupied by superb
windows filled with stone tracery and stained glass. It would be
impossible to combine the materials used more scientifically or
effectively. The cathedrals of Gerona (Spain) and of Alby (France; <a
href = "#fig123">Fig.&nbsp;123</a>) illustrate the same principle,
though in them the buttresses are internal and serve to separate the
flanking chapels.</p>

FIG. 107.&mdash;EARLY GOTHIC FLYING BUTTRESS.</p>

<p>The second distinctive principle of Gothic architecture was that of
<i>balanced thrusts</i>. In Roman buildings the thrust of the vaulting
was resisted wholly by the inertia of mass in the abutments. In Gothic
architecture thrusts were as far as possible resisted by
counter-thrusts, and the final resultant pressure was transmitted by
flying half-arches across the intervening portions of the structure to
external buttresses placed at convenient points. This combination
<span class = "pagenum">186</span>
<a name = "page186" id = "page186"> </a>
of flying half-arches and buttresses is called the
<i>flying-buttress</i> (Fig. 107). It reached its highest development in
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries in the cathedrals of central and
northern France.</p>


<p><b>RIBBED VAULTING.</b> These two principles formed the structural
basis of the Gothic styles. Their application led to the introduction of
two other elements, second only to them in importance, <i>ribbed
vaulting</i> and the <i>pointed arch</i>.</p>

<p class = "illustration float w150">

alt = "see caption and text"><br>
FIG. 108.&mdash;RIBBED VAULT, ENGLISH TYPE, WITH DIVIDED GROIN-RIBS AND
RIDGE-RIBS.</p>

<p>The first of these resulted from the effort to overcome certain
practical difficulties encountered in the building of large groined
vaults. As ordinarily constructed, a&nbsp;groined vault like that in <a
href = "#fig47">Fig.&nbsp;47</a>, must be built as one structure, upon
wooden centrings supporting its whole extent. The Romanesque architects
conceived the idea of constructing an independent skeleton of ribs. Two
of these were built against the wall (<i>wall-ribs</i>), two across the
nave (transverse ribs); and two others were made to coincide with the
groins (Figs. <a href = "#fig98">98</a>, 108). The <i>groin-ribs</i>,
intersecting at the centre of the vault, divided each bay into four
triangular portions, or <i>compartments</i>, each of which was really an
independent vault which could be separately constructed upon light
centrings supported by the groin-ribs themselves. This principle, though
identical in essence with the Roman system of brick skeleton-ribs for
concrete vaults, was, in application and detail, superior to it, both
from the scientific and artistic point of view. The ribs, richly
moulded, became, in the hands of the Gothic architects, important
decorative features. In practice the builder gave to each set of ribs
independently the curvature he desired. The vaulting-surfaces were then
easily twisted or warped so as to fit the
<span class = "pagenum">187</span>
<a name = "page187" id = "page187"> </a>
various ribs, which, being already in place, served as guides for their
construction.</p>

<i>a, a, Penetrations by small semi-circular vaults sprung from same
level. b, Intersection by small semi-circular vault sprung from higher
level; groins form wavy lines. c, Intersection by narrow pointed vault
sprung from same level; groins are plane curves.</i></p>

<p><b>THE POINTED ARCH</b> was adopted to remedy the difficulties
encountered in the construction of oblong vaults. It is obvious that
where a narrow semi-cylindrical vault intersects a wide one, it produces
either what are called <i>penetrations</i>, as at <i>a</i> (Fig. 109),
or intersections like that at&nbsp;<i>b</i>, both of which are awkward
in aspect and hard to construct. If, however, one or both vaults be
given a pointed section, the narrow vault may be made as high as the
wide one. It is then possible, with but little warping of the vaulting
surfaces, to make them intersect in groins&nbsp;<i>c</i>, which are
vertical plane curves instead of wavy loops like <i>a</i>
and&nbsp;<i>b</i>.</p>

<p>The Gothic architects availed themselves to the full of these two
devices. They built their groin-ribs of semi-circular or pointed form,
but the wall-ribs and the transverse ribs were, without exception,
pointed arches of such curvature as would bring the apex of each nearly
or quite to the level of the groin intersection. The pointed arch, thus
introduced as the most convenient form for the vaulting-ribs, was soon
applied to other parts of the structure.<!-- invisible . --> This was a
necessity with the windows and pier-arches, which would not otherwise
fit well the wall-spaces under the wall-ribs of the nave and aisle
vaulting.</p>

FIG. 110.&mdash;PLATE TRACERY, CHARLTON-ON-OXMORE.</p>

<p><b>TRACERY AND GLASS.</b> With the growth in the size of the windows
and the progressive suppression of the lateral walls
<span class = "pagenum">188</span>
<a name = "page188" id = "page188"> </a>
of vaulted structures, stained glass came more and more generally into
use. Its introduction not only resulted in a notable heightening and
enriching of the colors and scheme of the interior decoration, but
reacted on the architecture, intensifying the very causes which led to
its introduction. It stimulated the increase in the size of windows, and
the suppression of the walls, and contributed greatly to the development
of <i>tracery</i>. This latter feature was an absolute necessity for the
support of the glass. Its evolution can be traced (Figs, 110, 111, 112)
from the simple coupling of twin windows under a single hood-mould, or
discharging arch, to the florid net-work of the fifteenth century. In
its earlier forms it consisted merely of decorative openings, circles,
and quatrefoils, pierced through slabs of stone (<i>plate-tracery</i>),
filling the window-heads over coupled windows. Later attention was
bestowed upon the form of the stonework, which was made lighter and
richly moulded (<i>bar-tracery</i>), rather than upon that of the
openings (Fig. 111). Then the circular and geometric patterns employed
were abandoned for more flowing and capricious designs
(<i>Flamboyant</i> tracery, Fig. 112) or (in England) for more rigid and
rectangular arrangements (<i>Perpendicular</i>, <a href =
"#fig134">Fig.&nbsp;134</a>). It will be shown later that the periods
and styles of Gothic architecture are more easily identified by the
tracery than by any other feature.</p>


<p><b>CHURCH PLANS.</b> The original basilica-plan underwent radical
modifications during the 12th-15th centuries. These resulted in part
from the changes in construction
<span class = "pagenum">189</span>
<a name = "page189" id = "page189"> </a>
which have been described, and in part from altered ecclesiastical
conditions and requirements. Gothic church architecture was based on
cathedral design; and the requirements of the cathedral differed in many
respects from those of the monastic churches of the preceding
period.</p>

<p class = "illustration">

alt = "see caption and text"><br>
FIG. 111.&mdash;BAR TRACERY, ST. MICHAEL’S, WARFIELD.</p>

<p>The most important alterations in the plan were in the choir and
transepts. The choir was greatly lengthened, the transepts often
shortened. The choir was provided with two and often four side-aisles,
and one or both of these was commonly carried entirely around the
apsidal termination of the choir, forming a single or double
<i>ambulatory</i>. This combination of choir, apse, and ambulatory was
called, in French churches, the <i>chevet</i>.</p>

<p>Another advance upon Romanesque models was the multiplication of
chapels&mdash;a&nbsp;natural consequence of the more popular character
of the cathedral as compared with the abbey. Frequently lateral chapels
were built at each bay of the side-aisles, filling up the space between
the deep buttresses, flanking the nave as well as the choir. They were
also carried around the <i>chevet</i> in most of the French cathedrals
(Paris, Bourges, Reims, Amiens, Beauvais, and many others); in many of
those in Germany (Magdeburg, Cologne, Frauenkirche at Treves), Spain
(Toledo, Leon, Barcelona,
<span class = "pagenum">190</span>
<a name = "page190" id = "page190"> </a>
Segovia, etc.), and Belgium (Tournay, Antwerp). In England the choir had
more commonly a square eastward termination. Secondary transepts occur
frequently, and these peculiarities, together with the narrowness and
great length of most of the plans, make of the English cathedrals a
class by themselves.</p>

FIG. 112.&mdash;ROSE WINDOW, CHURCH OF ST. OUEN, ROUEN.</p>

<p><b>PROPORTIONS AND COMPOSITION.</b> Along with these modifications of
the basilican plan should be noticed a great increase in the height and
slenderness of all parts of the structure. The lofty clearstory, the
arcaded triforium-passage or gallery beneath it, the high pointed
pier-arches, the multiplication of slender clustered shafts, and the
reduction in the area of the piers, gave to the Gothic churches an
interior aspect wholly different from that of the simpler, lower, and
more massive Romanesque edifices. The perspective effects of the plans
thus modified, especially of the complex choir and <i>chevet</i> with
their lateral and radial chapels, were remarkably enriched and
varied.</p>

<p>The exterior was even more radically transformed by these changes,
and by the addition of towers and spires to the fronts, and sometimes to
the transepts and to their intersection with the nave. The deep
buttresses, terminating in pinnacles, the rich traceries of the great
lateral windows, the triple portals profusely sculptured, rose-windows
of great size under the front and transept gables, combined to produce

FIG. 113.&mdash;FLAMBOYANT DETAIL FROM PULPIT IN STRASBURG
CATHEDRAL.</p>

<p><b>DECORATIVE DETAIL.</b> The mediæval designers aimed to enrich
every constructive feature with the most effective play of lights and
shades, and to embody in the decorative detail the greatest possible
amount of allegory and symbolism, and sometimes of humor besides. The
deep jambs and soffits of doors and pier-arches were moulded with a rich
succession of hollow and convex members, and adorned with carvings of
saints, apostles, martyrs, and angels. Virtues and vices, allegories of
reward and punishment, and an extraordinary world of monstrous and
grotesque beasts, devils, and goblins filled the capitals and
door-arches, peeped over tower-parapets, or leered and grinned from
gargoyles and corbels. Another source of decorative detail was the
application of tracery like that of the windows to wall-panelling, to
balustrades, to open-work gables, to spires, to choir-screens, and other
features, especially in
<span class = "pagenum">192</span>
<a name = "page192" id = "page192"> </a>
the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries (cathedrals of York, Rouen,
Cologne; Henry VII.’s Chapel, Westminster). And finally in the carving
of capitals and the ornamentation of mouldings the artists of the
thirteenth century and their successors abandoned completely the classic
models and traditions which still survived in the early twelfth
century.<!-- invisible . --> The later monastic builders began to look
directly to nature for suggestions of decorative form. The lay builders
who sculptured the capitals and crockets and finials of the early Gothic
cathedrals adopted and followed to its finality this principle of
recourse to nature, especially to plant life. At first the budding
shoots of early spring were freely imitated or skilfully
conventionalized, as being by their thick and vigorous forms the best
adapted for translation into stone (Fig. 114). During the thirteenth
century the more advanced stages of plant growth, and leaves more
complex and detailed, furnished the models for the carver, who displayed
his skill in a closer and more literal imitation of their minute
veinings and indentations (Fig. 115).

This artistic adaptation of natural forms to architectural decoration
degenerated later into a minutely realistic copying of natural foliage,
in which cleverness of execution took the place of original invention.
The spirit of display is characteristic of all late Gothic work.
Slenderness, minuteness of detail, extreme complexity and intricacy of
design, an unrestrained profusion of decoration covering every surface,
a&nbsp;lack of largeness and vigor in the conceptions, are conspicuous
traits of Gothic design in the fifteenth century,
<span class = "pagenum">193</span>
<a name = "page193" id = "page193"> </a>
alike in France, England, Germany, Spain, and the Low Countries. Having
worked out to their conclusion the structural principles bequeathed to
them by the preceding centuries, the authors of these later works seemed
to have devoted themselves to the elaboration of mere decorative detail,
and in technical finish surpassed all that had gone before (Fig.
113).</p>

<p><b>CHARACTERISTICS SUMMARIZED.</b> In the light of the preceding
explanations Gothic architecture may be defined as that system of
structural design and decoration which grew up out of the effort to
combine, in one harmonious and organic conception, the basilican plan
with a complete and systematic construction of groined vaulting. Its
development was controlled throughout by considerations of stability and
structural propriety, but in the application of these considerations the
artistic spirit was allowed full scope for its exercise. Refinement,
good taste, and great fertility of imagination characterize the details
and ornaments of Gothic structures. While the Greeks in harmonizing the
requirements of utility and beauty in architecture approached the
problem from the æsthetic side, the Gothic architects did the same from
the structural side. Their admirably reasoned structures express as
perfectly the idea of vastness, mystery, and complexity as do the Greek
temples that of simplicity and monumental repose.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">194</span>
<a name = "page194" id = "page194"> </a>
<p>The excellence of Gothic architecture lay not so much in its
individual details as in its perfect adaptation to the purposes for
which it was developed&mdash;its triumphs were achieved in the building
of cathedrals and large churches. In the domain of civil and domestic
architecture it produced nothing comparable with its ecclesiastical
edifices, because it was the requirements of the cathedral and not of
the palace, town-hall, or dwelling, that gave it its form and
character.</p>


<p><b>PERIODS.</b> The history of Gothic architecture is commonly
divided into three periods, which are most readily distinguished by the
character of the window-tracery. These periods were not by any means
synchronous in the different countries; but the order of sequence was
everywhere the same. They are here given, with a summary of the
characteristics of each.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Early Pointed Period.</span> [<i>Early

<p><b>CATHEDRAL-BUILDING IN FRANCE.</b> In the development of the
principles outlined in the foregoing chapter the church-builders of
France led the way. They surpassed all their contemporaries in readiness
of invention, in quickness and directness of reasoning, and in artistic
refinement. These qualities were especially manifested in the
extraordinary architectural activity which marked the second half of the
twelfth century and the first half of the thirteenth. This was the great
age of cathedral-building in France. The adhesion of the bishops to the
royal cause, and their position in popular estimation as the champions
of justice and human rights, led to the rapid advance of the episcopacy
in power and influence. The cathedral, as the throne-church of the
bishop, became a truly popular institution. New cathedrals were founded
on every side, especially in the
<span class = "pagenum">197</span>
<a name = "page197" id = "page197"> </a>
Royal Domain and the adjoining provinces of Normandy, Burgundy, and
Champagne, and their construction was warmly seconded by the people, the
communes, and the municipalities. “Nothing to-day,” says
Viollet-le-Duc,<a class = "tag" name = "tag21" id = "tag21" href =
"#note21">21</a> “unless it be the commercial movement which has covered
Europe with railway lines, can give an idea of the zeal with which the
urban populations set about building cathedrals; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
a&nbsp;necessity at the end of the twelfth century because it was an
energetic protest against feudalism.” The collapse of the unscientific
Romanesque vaulting of some of the earlier cathedrals and the
destruction by fire of others stimulated this movement by the necessity
for their immediate rebuilding. The entire reconstruction of the
cathedrals of Bayeux, Bayonne, Cambray, Evreux, Laon, Lisieux, Le Mans,
Noyon, Poitiers, Senlis, Soissons, and Troyes was begun between 1130 and
1200.<a class = "tag" name = "tag22" id = "tag22" href =
"#note22">22</a> The cathedrals of Bourges, Chartres, Paris, and Tours,
and the abbey of St. Denis, all of the first importance, were begun
during the same period, and during the next quarter-century those of
Amiens, Auxerre, Rouen, Reims, Séez, and many others. After 1250 the
movement slackened and finally ceased. Few important cathedrals were
erected during the latter half of the thirteenth century, the chief
among them being at Beauvais (actively begun 1247), Clermont, Coutances,
Limoges, Narbonne, and Rodez. During this period, and through the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, French architecture was concerned
rather with the completion and remodelling of existing cathedrals than
the founding of new ones. There were, however, many important parish
churches and civil or domestic edifices erected within this period.</p>


<p><b>STRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENT: VAULTING.</b> By the middle of the twelfth
century the use of barrel-vaulting over the nave had been generally
abandoned and groined vaulting with
<span class = "pagenum">198</span>
<a name = "page198" id = "page198"> </a>
its isolated points of support and resistance had taken its place. The
timid experiments of the Clunisian architects at Vézelay in the use of
the pointed arch and vault-ribs also led, in the second half of the
twelfth century, to far-reaching results. The builders of the great
<b>Abbey Church</b> of <b>St. Denis</b>, near Paris, begun in 1140 by
the Abbot Suger, appear to have been the first to develop these
tentative devices into a system. In the original choir of this noble
church all the arches, alike of the vault-ribs (except the groin-ribs,
which were semi-circles) and of the openings, were pointed and the
vaults were throughout constructed with cross-ribs, wall-ribs, and
groin-ribs. Of this early work only the chapels remain. In other
contemporary monuments, as for instance in the cathedral of Sens, the
adoption of these devices was only partial and hesitating.</p>

FIG. 116.&mdash;PLAN OF NOTRE DAME, PARIS.</p>

<p><b>NOTRE DAME AT PARIS.</b> The next great step in advance was taken
in the cathedral of <b>Notre Dame</b><a class = "tag" name = "tag23" id
= "tag23" href = "#note23">23</a> at Paris (Figs. 116, 117, <a href =
"#fig125">125</a>). This was begun, under Maurice de Sully in 1163, on
the site of the twin cathedrals of Ste. Marie and St. Étienne, and the
choir was, as usual, the first portion erected. By 1196 the choir,
transepts, and one or two bays of the nave were substantially finished.
The completeness, harmony, and vigor of conception of this remarkable
church contrast strikingly with the makeshifts and hesitancy displayed
in many contemporary monuments
<span class = "pagenum">199</span>
<a name = "page199" id = "page199"> </a>
in other provinces. The difficult vaulting over the radiating bays of
the double ambulatory was here treated with great elegance. By doubling
the number of supports in the exterior circuit of each aisle (Fig. 116)
each trapezoidal bay of the vaulting was divided into three easily
managed triangular compartments. Circular shafts were used between the
central and side aisles. The side aisles were doubled and those next the
centre were built in two stories, providing ample galleries behind a
very open triforium. The nave was unusually lofty and covered with
six-part vaults of admirable execution. The vault-ribs were vigorously
moulded and each made to spring from a distinct vaulting-shaft, of which
three rested upon the cap of each of the massive piers below (Fig. 117).
The <b>Cathedral</b> of <b>Bourges</b>, begun 1190, closely resembled
that of Paris in plan. Both were designed to accommodate vast throngs in
their exceptionally broad central aisles and double side aisles, but
Bourges has no side-aisle galleries, though the inner aisles are much
loftier than the outer ones. Though
<span class = "pagenum">200</span>
<a name = "page200" id = "page200"> </a>
later in date the vaulting of Bourges is inferior to that of Notre Dame,
especially in the treatment of the trapezoidal bays of the
ambulatory.</p>

<p>The masterly examples set by the vault-builders of St. Denis and
Notre Dame were not at once generally followed. Noyon, Senlis, and
Soissons, contemporary with these, are far less completely Gothic in
style. At <b>Le Mans</b> the groined vaulting which in 1158 was
substituted for the original barrel-vault of the cathedral is of very
primitive design, singularly heavy and awkward, although nearly
contemporary with that of Notre Dame (Fig. 118).</p>

FIG. 118.&mdash;LE MANS CATHEDRAL. NAVE.</p>


<p><b>DOMICAL GROINED VAULTING.</b> The builders of the South and West,
influenced by Aquitanian models, adhered to the square plan and domical
form of vaulting-bay, even after they had begun to employ groin-ribs.
The latter, as at first used by them in imitation of Northern examples,
had no organic function in the vault, which was still built like a dome.
About 1145&ndash;1160 the cathedral of <b>St. Maurice</b> at
<b>Angers</b> was vaulted with square, groin-ribbed vaults, domical in
form but not in construction. The joints no longer described horizontal
circles as in a dome, but oblique lines perpendicular to the groins and
meeting in zigzag lines at the ridge (Fig. 119). This method became
common in the West and was afterward generally adopted
<span class = "pagenum">201</span>
<a name = "page201" id = "page201"> </a>
by the English architects. The <b>Cathedrals</b> of <b>Poitiers</b>
(1162) and <b>Laval</b> (La Trinité, 1180&ndash;1185) are examples of
this system, which at Le Mans met with the Northern system and produced
in the cathedral the awkward compromise described above.</p>

--></p>

<p><b>THIRTEENTH-CENTURY VAULTING.</b> Early in the thirteenth century
the church-builders of Northern France abandoned the use of square
vaulting-bays and six-part vaults. By the adoption of groin-ribs and the
pointed arch, the building of vaults in oblong bays was greatly
simplified. Each bay of the nave could now be covered with its own
vaulting-bay, thus doing away with all necessity for alternately light
and heavy piers. It is not quite certain when and where this system was
first adopted for the complete vaulting of a church. It is, however,
probable that the <b>Cathedral</b> of <b>Chartres</b>, begun in 1194 and
completed before 1240, deserves this distinction, although it is
possible that the vaults of Soissons and Noyon may slightly antedate it.
<b>Troyes</b> (1170&ndash;1267), <b>Rouen</b> (1202&ndash;1220),
<b>Reims</b> (1212&ndash;1242), <b>Auxerre</b> (1215&ndash;1234, nave
fourteenth century), <b>Amiens</b> (1220&ndash;1288), and nearly all the
great churches and chapels begun after 1200, employ the fully developed
oblong vault.</p>


<p><b>BUTTRESSING.</b> Meanwhile the increasing height of the
clearstories and the use of double aisles compelled the bestowal of
especial attention upon the buttressing. The nave and choir of Chartres,
the choirs of Notre Dame,
<span class = "pagenum">202</span>
<a name = "page202" id = "page202"> </a>
Bourges, Rouen, and Reims, the chevet and later the choir of St. Denis,
afford early examples of the flying-buttress (<a href =
"#fig107">Fig.&nbsp;107</a>). These were at first simple and of moderate
height. Single half-arches spanned the side aisles; in Notre Dame they
crossed the double aisles in a single leap. Later the buttresses were
given greater stability by the added weight of lofty pinnacles. An
intermediate range of buttresses and pinnacles was built over the
intermediate piers where double aisles flanked the nave and choir, thus
dividing the single flying arch into two arches. At the same time a
careful observation of statical defects in the earlier examples led to
the introduction of subordinate arches and of other devices to stiffen
and to beautify the whole system. At <b>Reims</b> and <b>Amiens</b>
these features received their highest development, though later examples
are frequently much more ornate.</p>

FIG. 120.&mdash;ONE BAY, ABBEY OF ST. DENIS.</p>

<p><b>INTERIOR DESIGN.</b> The progressive change outlined in the last
chapter, by which the wall was practically suppressed, the windows
correspondingly enlarged, and every part of the structure made loftier
and more slender, resulted in the evolution of a system of interior
design well represented by the nave of Amiens. The second story or
gallery over the side aisle disappeared, but the aisle itself was very
high. The triforium was no longer a gallery, but a richly arcaded
passage in the thickness of the wall, corresponding to the roofing-space
over the aisle, and generally treated like a lower stage of the
clearstory. Nearly the whole space above it was occupied in each bay by
the vast clearstory window filled with simple but effective geometric
tracery over slender mullions. The side aisles were lighted by windows
which, like those in the clearstory, occupied nearly the whole available
wall-space under the vaulting. The piers and shafts were all clustered
and remarkably slender. The whole construction of this vast edifice,
which covers nearly eighty thousand square feet, is a marvel of
<span class = "pagenum">203</span>
<a name = "page203" id = "page203"> </a>
lightness, of scientific combinations, and of fine execution. Its great
vault rises to a height of one hundred and forty feet. The nave of St.
Denis, though less lofty, resembles it closely in style (Fig. 120).
Earlier cathedrals show less of the harmony of proportion, the perfect
working out of the relation of all parts of the composition of each bay,
so conspicuous in the Amiens type, which was followed in most of the
later churches.</p>


<p><b>WINDOWS: TRACERY.</b> The clearstory windows of Noyon, Soissons,
Sens, and the choir of Vézelay (1200) were simple arched openings
arranged singly, in pairs, or in threes. In the cathedral of Chartres
(1194&ndash;1220) they consist of two arched windows with a circle above
them, forming a sort of plate tracery under a single arch. In the chapel
windows of the choir at Reims (1215) the tracery of mullions and circles
was moulded inside and out, and the intermediate triangular spaces all
pierced and glazed. Rose windows were early used in front and transept
façades. During the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries they were made
of vast size and great lightness of tracery, as in the transepts of
Notre Dame (1257) and the west front of Amiens (1288). From the design
of these windows is derived the name <i>Rayonnant</i>, often applied to
the French Gothic style of the period 1275&ndash;1375.</p>

FIG. 121.&mdash;THE STE. CHAPELLE, PARIS.</p>

<p><b>THE SAINTE CHAPELLE.</b> In this beautiful royal chapel at Paris,
built 1242&ndash;47, Gothic design was admirably exemplified in the
noble windows 15 by 50 feet in size, which perhaps furnished the models
for those of Amiens and&nbsp;St.
<span class = "pagenum">204</span>
<a name = "page204" id = "page204"> </a>
Denis. Each was divided by slender mullions into four lancet-like lights
gathered under the rich tracery of the window-head. They were filled
with stained glass of the most brilliant but harmonious hues. They
occupy the whole available wall-space, so that the ribbed vault
internally seems almost to rest on walls of glass, so slender are the
visible supports and so effaced by the glow of color in the windows.
Certainly lightness of construction and the suppression of the
wall-masonry could hardly be carried further than here (Fig. 121). Among
other chapels of the same type are those in the palace of St.
Germain-en-Laye (1240), and a later example in the château of Vincennes,
begun by Charles VI., but not finished till 1525.</p>

FIG. 122.&mdash;PLAN OF AMIENS CATHEDRAL.</p>

<p><b>PLANS.</b> The most radical change from the primitive basilican
type was, as already explained in the last chapter, the continuation of
the side aisles around the apse to form a <i>chevet</i>; and later, the
addition of chapels between the external buttresses. Radiating chapels,
usually semi-octagons or semi-decagons in plan, early appeared as
additions to the <i>chevet</i> (Fig. 122). These may have originated in
the apsidal chapels of Romanesque churches in Auvergne and the South, as
at Issoire, Clermont-Ferrand, Le Puy, and Toulouse.<!-- invisible . -->
<span class = "pagenum">205</span>
<a name = "page205" id = "page205"> </a>
They generally superseded the transept-chapels of earlier churches, and
added greatly to the beauty of the interior perspective, especially when
the encircling aisles of the chevet were doubled. Notre Dame, as at
first erected, had a double ambulatory, but no chapels. Bourges has only
five very small semicircular chapels. Chartres (choir 1220) and Le Mans,
as reconstructed about the same date, have double ambulatories and
radial chapels. After 1220 the second ambulatory no longer appears.
Noyon, Soissons, Reims, Amiens, Troyes, and Beauvais, Tours, Bayeux, and
Coutances, Clermont, Limoges, and Narbonne all have the single
ambulatory and radiating chevet-chapels. The Lady-chapel in the axis of
the church was often made longer and more important than the other
chapels, as at Amiens, Le Mans, Rouen, Bayeux, and Coutances. Chapels
also flanked the choir in most of the cathedrals named above, and Notre
Dame and Tours also have side chapels to the nave. The only cathedrals
with complete double side aisles alike to nave, choir, and chevet, were
Notre Dame and Bourges. It is somewhat singular that the German
cathedral of Cologne is the only one in which all these various
characteristic French features were united in one design (see <a href =
"#fig140">Fig.&nbsp;140</a>).</p>

<p>Local considerations had full sway in France, in spite of the
tendency toward unity of type. Thus Dol, Laon, and Poitiers have square
eastward terminations; Châlons has no ambulatory; Bourges no transept.
In Notre Dame the transept was almost suppressed. At Soissons one
transept, at Noyon both, had semicircular ends. <b>Alby</b>, a&nbsp;late
cathedral of brick,
<span class = "pagenum">206</span>

founded in 1280, but mostly built during the fourteenth century, has
neither side aisles nor transepts, its wide nave being flanked by
chapels separated by internal buttresses (Fig. 123).</p>


<p><b>SCALE.</b> The French cathedrals were nearly all of imposing
dimensions. Noyon, one of the smallest, is 333 feet long; Sens measures
354. Laon, Bourges, Troyes, Notre Dame, Le Mans, Rouen, and Chartres
vary from 396 to 437 feet in extreme length; Reims measures 483, and
Amiens, the longest of all, 521 feet. Notre Dame is 124 feet wide across
the five aisles of the nave; Bourges, somewhat wider. The central aisles
of these two cathedrals, and of Laon, Amiens, and Beauvais, have a span
of not far from 40 feet from centre to centre of the piers; while the
ridge of the vaulting, which in Notre Dame is 108 feet above the
pavement, and in Bourges 125, reaches in Amiens a height of 140 feet,
and of nearly 160 in Beauvais. This emphasis of the height, from 3 to 3½
times the clear width of the nave or choir, is one of the most striking
features of the French cathedrals. It produces an impressive effect, but
tends to dwarf the great width of the central aisle.</p>

<p><b>EXTERIOR DESIGN.</b> Here, as in the interior, every feature had
its constructive <i>raison d’être</i>, and the total effect was
determined by the fundamental structural scheme. This was especially
true of the lateral elevations, in which the pinnacled buttresses, the
flying arches, and the traceried windows of the side aisle and
clearstory, repeated uniformly at each bay, were the principal elements
of the design.
<span class = "pagenum">207</span>
<a name = "page207" id = "page207"> </a>
The transept façades and main front allowed greater scope for invention
and fancy, but even here the interior membering gave the key to the
composition. Strong buttresses marked the division of the aisles and
resisted the thrust of the terminal pier arches, and rose windows filled
the greater part of the wall space under the end of the lofty vaulting.
The whole structure was crowned by a steep-pitched roof of wood, covered
with lead, copper, or tiles, to protect the vault from damage by snow
and moisture. This roof occasioned the steep gables which crowned the
transept and main façades. The main front was frequently adorned, above
the triple portal, with a gallery of niches or tabernacles filled with
statues of kings. Different types of composition are represented by
Chartres, Notre Dame, Amiens, Reims, and Rouen, of which Notre Dame
(Fig. 124) and Reims are perhaps the finest. Notre Dame is especially
remarkable for its stately simplicity and the even balancing of
horizontal and vertical elements.</p>

<p><b>PORCHES.</b> In most French church façades the porches were the
most striking features, with their deep shadows and sculptured
arches.<!-- invisible . --> The Romanesque porches were
<span class = "pagenum">208</span>
<a name = "page208" id = "page208"> </a>
usually limited in depth to the thickness of the front wall. The Gothic
builders secured increased depth by projecting the portals out beyond
the wall, and crowned them with elaborate gables. The vast central door
was divided in two by a pier adorned with a niche and statue. Over this
the tympanum of the arch was carved with scriptural reliefs; the jambs
and arches were profusely adorned with figures of saints, apostles,
martyrs, and angels, under elaborate canopies. The porches of Laon,
Bourges, Amiens, and Reims are especially deep and majestic in effect,
the last-named (built 1380) being the richest of all. Some of the
transept façades also had imposing portals. Those of <b>Chartres</b>
(1210&ndash;1245) rank among the finest works of Gothic decorative
architecture, the south porch in some respects surpassing that of the
north transept. The portals
<span class = "pagenum">209</span>
<a name = "page209" id = "page209"> </a>
of the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries were remarkable for the
extraordinary richness and minuteness of their tracery and sculpture, as
at Abbeville, Alençon, the cathedral and St. Maclou at Rouen (Fig. 125),
Tours, Troyes, Vendôme, etc.</p>


<p><b>TOWERS AND SPIRES.</b> The emphasizing of vertical elements
reached its fullest expression in the towers and spires of the churches.
What had been at first merely a lofty belfry roof was rapidly developed
into the spire, rising three hundred feet or more into the air. This
development had already made progress in the Romanesque period, and the
south spire of Chartres is a notable example of late twelfth-century
steeple design. The transition from the square tower to the slender
octagonal pyramid was skilfully effected by means of corner pinnacles
and dormers. During and after the thirteenth century the development was
almost wholly in the direction of richness and complexity of detail, not
of radical constructive modification. The northern spire of Chartres
(1515) and the spires of Bordeaux, Coutances, Senlis, and the Flamboyant
church of St. Maclou at Rouen, illustrate this development. In Normandy
central spires were common, rising over the crossing of nave and
transepts. In some cases the designers of cathedrals contemplated a
group of towers; this is evident at Chartres, Coutances, and Reims. This
intention was, however, never realized; it demanded resources beyond
even the enthusiasm of the thirteenth century. Only in rare instances
were the spires of any of the towers completed, and the majority of the
French towers have square terminations, with low-pitched wooden roofs,
generally invisible from below. In general, French towers are marked by
their strong buttresses, solid lower stories, twin windows in each side
of the belfry proper&mdash;these windows being usually of great
size&mdash;and a skilful management of the transition to an octagonal
plan for the belfry or the spire.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">210</span>
<a name = "page210" id = "page210"> </a>
<p><b>CARVING AND SCULPTURE.</b> The general superiority of French
Gothic work was fully maintained in its decorative details. Especially
fine is the figure sculpture, which in the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries attained true nobility of expression, combined with great
truthfulness and delicacy of execution. Some of its finest productions
are found in the great doorway jambs of the west portals of the
cathedrals, and in the ranks of throned and adoring angels which adorned
their deep arches. These reach their highest beauty in the portals of
Reims (1380). The <i>tabernacles</i> or carved niches in which such
statues were set were important elements in the decoration of the
exteriors of churches.</p>

<p>Foliage forms were used for nearly all the minor carved ornaments,
though grotesque and human figures sometimes took their place. The
gargoyles through which the roof-water was discharged clear of the
building, were almost always composed in the form of hideous monsters;
and symbolic beasts, like the oxen in the towers of Laon, or monsters
like those which peer from the tower balustrades
<span class = "pagenum">211</span>
<a name = "page211" id = "page211"> </a>
of Notre Dame, were employed with some mystical significance in various
parts of the building. But the capitals corbels, crockets, and finials
were mostly composed of floral or foliage forms. Those of the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries were for the most part simple in mass, and
crisp and vigorous in design, imitating the strong shoots of early
spring. The <b>capitals</b> were tall and slender, concave in profile,
with heavy square or octagonal abaci. With the close of the thirteenth
century this simple and forcible style of detail disappeared. The
carving became more realistic; the leaves, larger and more mature, were
treated as if applied to the capital or moulding, not as if they grew
out of it. The execution and detail were finer and more delicate, in
harmony with the increasing slenderness and lightness of the
architecture (Fig. 126 <i>a</i>,&nbsp;<i>b</i>). <b>Tracery forms</b>
now began to be profusely applied to all manner of surfaces, and
open-work gables, wholly unnecessary from the structural point of view,
but highly effective as decorations, adorned the portals and crowned the
windows.</p>


<p><b>LATE GOTHIC MONUMENTS.</b> So far our attention has been mainly
occupied with the masterpieces erected previous to 1250. Among the
cathedrals, relatively few in number, whose construction is referable to
the second half of the century, that of <b>Beauvais</b> stands first in
importance. Designed on a colossal scale, its foundations were laid in
1225, but it was never completed, and the portion built&mdash;the choir
and chapels&mdash;belonged really to the second half of the century,
having been completed in 1270. But the collapse in 1284 of the central
tower and vaulting of this incomplete cathedral, owing to the excessive
loftiness and slenderness of its supports, compelled its entire
reconstruction, the number of the piers being doubled and the span of
the pier arches correspondingly reduced. As thus rebuilt, the cathedral
aisle was 47 feet wide from centre to centre of opposite piers, and 163
feet high to the top of the vault.
<span class = "pagenum">212</span>
<a name = "page212" id = "page212"> </a>
Transepts were added after 1500. <b>Limoges</b> and <b>Narbonne</b>,
begun in 1272 on a large scale (though not equal in size to Beauvais),
were likewise never completed. Both had choirs of admirable plan, with
well-designed chevet-chapels. Many other cathedrals begun during this
period were completed only after long delays, as, for instance, Meaux,
Rodez (1277), Toulouse (1272), and Alby (1282), finished in the
sixteenth century, and Clermont (1248), completed under Napoleon III.
But between 1260 or 1275 and 1350, work was actively prosecuted on many
still incomplete cathedrals. The choirs of Beauvais (rebuilding),
Limoges, and Narbonne were finished after 1330; and towers,
transept-façades, portals, and chapels added to many others of earlier
date.</p>

<p>The style of this period is sometimes designated as <b>Rayonnant</b>,
from the characteristic wheel tracery of the rose-windows, and the
prevalence of circular forms in the lateral arched windows, of the late
thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries. The great rose windows in the
transepts of Notre Dame, dating from 1257, are typical examples of the
style. Those of Rouen cathedral belong to the same category, though of
later date. The façade of Amiens, completed by 1288, is one of the
finest works of this style, of which an early example is the elaborate
parish church of <b>St. Urbain</b> at Troyes.</p>


<p><b>THE FLAMBOYANT STYLE.</b> The geometric treatment of the tracery
and the minute and profuse decoration of this period gradually merged
into the fantastic and unrestrained extravagances of the
<b>Flamboyant</b> style, which prevailed until the advent of the
Renaissance&mdash;say 1525. The continuous logical development of forms
ceased, and in its place caprice and display controlled the arts of
design. The finest monument of this long period is the fifteenth-century
nave and central tower of the church of <b>St. Ouen</b> at Rouen,
a&nbsp;parish church of the first rank, begun in 1318, but not finished
<span class = "pagenum">213</span>
<a name = "page213" id = "page213"> </a>
until 1515. The tracery of the lateral windows is still chiefly
geometric, but the western rose window (<a href =
"#fig112">Fig.&nbsp;112</a>) and the magnificent central tower or
lantern, exhibit in their tracery the florid decoration and wavy,
flame-like lines of this style. Slenderness of supports and the
suppression of horizontal lines are here carried to an extreme; and the
church, in spite of its great elegance of detail, lacks the vital
interest and charm of the earlier Gothic churches. The cathedral of
Alençon and the church of <b>St. Maclou</b> at Rouen, have portals with
unusually elaborate detail of tracery and carving; while the façade of
Rouen cathedral (1509) surpasses all other examples in the lace-like
minuteness of its open-work and its profusion of ornament. The churches
of <b>St. Jacques</b> at Dieppe, and of <b>St. Wulfrand</b> at
Abbeville, the façades of Tours and Troyes, are among the masterpieces
of the style. The upper part of the façade of Reims (1380&ndash;1428)
belongs to the transition from the Rayonnant to the Flamboyant. While
some works of this period are conspicuous for the richness of their
ornamentation, others are noticeably bare and poor in design, like St.
Merri and St. Séverin in Paris.</p>


<p><b>SECULAR AND MONASTIC ARCHITECTURE.</b> The building of cathedrals
did not absorb all the architectural activity of the French during the
Gothic period, nor did it by any means put an end to monastic building.
While there are few Gothic cloisters to equal the Romanesque cloisters
of Puy-en-Vélay, Montmajour, Elne, and Moissac, many of the abbeys
either rebuilt their churches in the Gothic style after 1150, or
extended and remodelled their conventual buildings. The cloisters of
Fontfroide, Chaise-Dieu, and the Mont St. Michel rival those of
Romanesque times, while many new refectories and chapels were built in
the same style with the cathedrals. The most complete of these Gothic
monastic establishments, that of the <b>Mont St. Michel</b> in Normandy,
presented a remarkable aggregation
<span class = "pagenum">214</span>
<a name = "page214" id = "page214"> </a>
of buildings clustering around the steep isolated rock on which stands
the abbey church. This was built in the eleventh century, and the choir
and chapels remodelled in the sixteenth. The great refectory and
dormitory, the cloisters, lodgings, and chapels, built in several
vaulted stories against the cliffs, are admirable examples of the
vigorous pointed-arch design of the early thirteenth century.</p>

<p><b>Hospitals</b> like that of St. Jean at Angers (late twelfth
century), or those of Chartres, Ourscamps, Tonnerre, and Beaune,
illustrate how skilfully the French could modify and adapt the details
of their architecture to the special requirements of civil architecture.
Great numbers of charitable institutions were built in the middle
ages&mdash;asylums, hospitals, refuges, and the like&mdash;but very few
of those in France are now extant. Town halls were built in the
fifteenth century in some places where a certain amount of popular
independence had been secured. The florid fifteenth-century <b>Palais de
Justice</b> at <b>Rouen</b> (1499&ndash;1508) is an example of another
branch of secular Gothic architecture. In all these monuments the
adaptation of means to ends is admirable. Wooden ceilings and roofs
replaced stone, wherever required by great width of span or economy of
construction. There was little sculpture; the wall-spaces were not
suppressed in favor of stained glass and tracery; while the roofs were
usually emphasized and adorned with elaborate crestings and finials in
lead or terra-cotta.</p>


<p><b>DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE.</b> These same principles controlled the
designing of houses, farm buildings, barns, granaries, and the like. The
common closely-built French city house of the twelfth and thirteenth
century is illustrated by many extant examples at Cluny, Provins, and
other towns. A&nbsp;shop opening on the street by a large arch,
a&nbsp;narrow stairway, and two or three stories of rooms lighted by
clustered, pointed-arched windows, constituted the common
<span class = "pagenum">215</span>
<a name = "page215" id = "page215"> </a>
type. The street front was usually gabled and the roof steep. In the
fourteenth or fifteenth century half-timbered construction began to
supersede stone for town houses, as it permitted of encroaching upon the
street by projecting the upper stories. Many of the half-timbered houses
of the fifteenth century were of elaborate design. The heavy oaken
uprights were carved with slender colonnettes; the horizontal sills,
bracketed out over the street, were richly moulded; picturesque dormers
broke the sky-line, and the masonry filling between the beams was
frequently faced with enamelled tiles.</p>

FIG. 127.&mdash;HOUSE OF JACQUES CŒUR, BOURGES.<br>
<span class = "caption">
(After Viollet-le-Duc.)</span></p>

<p>The more considerable houses or palaces of royalty, nobles, and
wealthy citizens rivalled, and in time surpassed, the monastic buildings
in richness and splendor. The earlier examples retain the military
aspect, with moat and donjon, as in the Louvre of Charles&nbsp;V.,
demolished in
<span class = "pagenum">216</span>
<a name = "page216" id = "page216"> </a>
the sixteenth century. The finest palaces are of late date, and the type
is well represented by the Ducal Palace at Nancy (1476), the <b>Hotel de
Cluny</b> (1485) at Paris, the <b>Hotel Jacques Cœur</b> at Bourges
(Fig. 127), and the east wing of Blois (1498&ndash;1515). These palaces
are not only excellently and liberally planned, with large halls, many
staircases, and handsome courts; they are also extremely picturesque
with their square and circular towers, slender turrets, elaborate
dormers, and rich carved detail.</p>

<p><b>GENERAL CHARACTER.</b> Gothic architecture was developed in
England under a strongly established royal power, with an episcopate in
no sense hostile to the abbots or in arms against the barons. Many of
the cathedrals had monastic chapters, and not infrequently abbots were
invested with the episcopal rank.</p>

<p>English Gothic architecture was thus by no means predominantly an
architecture of cathedrals. If architectural activity in England was on
this account less intense and widespread in the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries than in France, it was not, on the other hand, so soon
exhausted. Fewer new cathedrals were built, but the progressive
rebuilding of those already existing seems not to have ceased until the
middle or end of the fifteenth century. Architecture
<span class = "pagenum">219</span>
<a name = "page219" id = "page219"> </a>
in England developed more slowly, but more uniformly than in France. It
contented itself with simpler problems; and if it failed to rival Amiens
in boldness of construction and in lofty majesty, it at least never
perpetrated a folly like Beauvais. In richness of internal decoration,
especially in the mouldings and ribbed vaulting, and in the picturesque
grouping of simple masses externally, the British builders went far
toward atoning for their structural timidity.</p>

FIG. 128.&mdash;PLAN OF SALISBURY CATHEDRAL.</p>


<p><b>EARLY GOTHIC BUILDINGS.</b> The pointed arch and ribbed vault were
importations from France. Early examples appear in the Cistercian abbeys
of Furness and Kirkstall, and in the Temple Church at London (1185). But
it was in the <b>Choir of Canterbury</b>, as rebuilt by William of Sens,
after the destruction by fire in 1170 of Anselm’s Norman choir, that
these French Gothic features were first applied in a thoroughgoing
manner. In plan this choir resembled that of the cathedral of Sens; and
its coupled round piers, with capitals carved with foliage, its pointed
arches, its six-part vaulting, and its <i>chevet</i>, were distinctly
French. The Gothic details thus introduced slowly supplanted the round
arch and other Norman features. For fifty years the styles were more or
less mingled in many buildings, though <b>Lincoln Cathedral</b>, as
rebuilt in 1185&ndash;1200, retained nothing of the earlier round-arched
style. But the first church to be designed and built from the
foundations in the new style was the cathedral of <b>Salisbury</b>
(1220&ndash;1258; Fig. 128). Contemporary with Amiens, it is a
homogeneous and typical example of the
<span class = "pagenum">220</span>
<a name = "page220" id = "page220"> </a>
Early English style. The predilection for great length observable in the
Anglo-Norman churches (as at Norwich and Durham) still prevailed, as it
continued to do throughout the Gothic period; Salisbury is 480 feet
long. The double transepts, the long choir, the square east end, the
relatively low vault (84 feet to the ridge), the narrow grouped windows,
all are thoroughly English. Only the simple four-part vaulting recalls
French models. <b>Westminster Abbey</b> (1245&ndash;1269), on the other
hand, betrays in a marked manner the French influence in its internal
loftiness (100 feet), its polygonal <i>chevet</i> and chapels, and its
strongly accented exterior flying-buttresses (<a href =
"#fig137">Fig.&nbsp;137</a>).</p>


<p><b>MIXTURE OF STYLES.</b> Very few English cathedrals are as
homogeneous as the two just mentioned, nearly all having undergone
repeated remodellings in successive periods. Durham, Norwich, and Oxford
are wholly Norman but for their Gothic vaults. Ely, Rochester,
Gloucester, and Hereford have Norman naves and Gothic choirs.
Peterborough has an early Gothic façade and late Gothic retro-choir
added to an otherwise completely Norman structure. Winchester is a
Norman church remodelled with early Perpendicular details. The purely
Gothic churches and cathedrals, except parish churches&mdash;in which
England is very rich&mdash;are not nearly as numerous in England as in
France.</p>


<p><b>PERIODS.</b> The development of English Gothic architecture
followed the same general sequence as the French, and like it the
successive stages were most conspicuously characterized by the forms of
the tracery.</p>

<p>The <span class = "smallcaps">Early English</span> or <span class =
"smallcaps">Lancet</span> period extended roundly from 1175 or 1180 to
1280, and was marked by simplicity, dignity, and purity of design.</p>

<p>The <span class = "smallcaps">Decorated</span> or <span class =
"smallcaps">Geometric</span> period covered another century, 1280 to
1380, and was characterized by its decorative richness and greater
lightness of construction.</p>

<p>The <span class = "smallcaps">Perpendicular</span> period extended
from 1380, or
<span class = "pagenum">221</span>
<a name = "page221" id = "page221"> </a>
thereabout, well into the sixteenth century. Its salient features were
the use of fan-vaulting, four-centred arches, and tracery of
predominantly vertical and horizontal lines. The tardy introduction of
Renaissance forms finally put an end to the Gothic style in England,
after a long period of mixed and transitional architecture.</p>

FIG. 129.&mdash;RIBBED VAULTING, CHOIR OF EXETER CATHEDRAL.</p>

<p><b>VAULTING.</b> The richness and variety of English vaulting
contrast strikingly with the persistent uniformity of the French.
A&nbsp;few of the early Gothic vaults, as in the aisles of Peterborough,
and later the naves of Durham, Salisbury, and Gloucester, were simple
four-part, ribbed vaults substantially like the French. But the English
disliked and avoided the twisted and dome-like surfaces of the French
vaults, preferring horizontal ridges, and, in the filling-masonry,
straight courses meeting at the ridge in zigzag lines, as in southwest
France (see <a href = "#page200">p.&nbsp;200</a>). This may be seen in
Westminster Abbey. The idea of ribbed construction was then seized upon
and given a new application. By springing a large number of ribs from
each point of support, the vaulting-surfaces were divided into long,
narrow, triangles, the filling of which was comparatively easy (Fig.
129). The ridge was itself furnished with a straight rib, decorated with
carved rosettes or <i>bosses</i> at each intersection with a
vaulting-rib. The naves and choirs of Lincoln, Lichfield, Exeter, and
the nave of Westminster
<span class = "pagenum">222</span>
<a name = "page222" id = "page222"> </a>
illustrate this method. The logical corollary of this practice was the
introduction of minor ribs called <i>liernes</i>, connecting the main
ribs and forming complex reticulated and star-shaped patterns. Vaults of
this description are among the most beautiful in England. One of the
richest is in the choir of Gloucester (1337&ndash;1377). Less correct
constructively is that over the choir of Wells, while the choir of Ely,
the nave of Tewkesbury Abbey (Fig. 130), and all the vaulting of
Winchester as rebuilt by William of Wykeham (1390), illustrate the same
system. Such vaults are called <i>lierne</i> or <i>star</i> vaults.</p>

FIG. 130.&mdash;NET OR LIERNE VAULTING, TEWKESBURY ABBEY.</p>


<p><b>FAN-VAULTING.</b> The next step in the process may be observed in
the vaults of the choir of Oxford Cathedral (Christ Church), of the
retro-choir of Peterborough, of the cloisters of Gloucester, and many
other examples. The diverging ribs being made of uniform curvature, the
<i>severeys</i> (the inverted pyramidal vaulting-masses springing from
each support) became a species of concave conoids, meeting at the
<span class = "pagenum">223</span>
<a name = "page223" id = "page223"> </a>
ridge in such a way as to leave a series of flat lozenge-shaped spaces
at the summit of the vault (<a href = "#fig136">Fig.&nbsp;136</a>). The
ribs were multiplied indefinitely, and losing thus in individual and
structural importance became a mere decorative pattern of tracery on the
severeys. To conceal the awkward flat lozenges at the ridge, elaborate
panelling was resorted to; or, in some cases, long stone pendents were
inserted at those points&mdash;a&nbsp;device highly decorative but
wholly unconstructive. At Cambridge, in <b>King’s College Chapel</b>, at
Windsor, in <b>St. George’s Chapel</b>, and in the <b>Chapel of Henry
VII.</b> at Westminster, this sort of vaulting received its most
elaborate development. The <i>fan-vault</i>, as it is called,
illustrates the logical evolution of a decorative element from a
structural starting&mdash;point, leading to results far removed from the
original conception. Rich and sumptuous as are these ceilings, they are
with all their ornament less satisfactory than the ribbed vaults of the
preceding period.</p>

FIG. 131.&mdash;VAULT OF CHAPTER-HOUSE, WELLS.</p>

<p><b>CHAPTER-HOUSES.</b> One of the most beautiful forms of ribbed
vaulting was developed in the polygonal halls erected for the
deliberations of the cathedral chapters of Lincoln (1225), Westminster
(1250), Salisbury (1250), and Wells (1292), in which the vault-ribs
radiated from a central column to the sides and angles of the polygon
(Fig. 131). If
<span class = "pagenum">224</span>
<a name = "page224" id = "page224"> </a>
these vaults were less majestic than domes of the same diameter, they
were far more decorative and picturesque, while the chapter-houses
themselves were the most original and striking products of English
Gothic art. Every feature was designed with strict regard for the
structural system determined by the admirable vaulting, and the Sainte
Chapelle was not more logical in its exemplification of Gothic
principles. To the four above-mentioned examples should be added that of
York (1280&ndash;1330), which differs from them in having no central
column: by some critics it is esteemed the finest of them all. Its
ceiling is a Gothic dome, 57 feet in diameter, but unfortunately
executed in wood. Its geometrical window-tracery and richly canopied
stalls are admirable.</p>


<p><b>OCTAGON AT ELY.</b> The magnificent <b>Octagon</b> of Ely
Cathedral, at the intersection of the nave and transepts, belongs in the
same category with these polygonal chapter-house vaults. It was built by
Alan of Walsingham in 1337, after the fall of the central tower and the
destruction of the adjacent bays of the choir. It occupies the full
width of the three aisles, and covers the ample space thus enclosed with
a simple but beautiful groined and ribbed vault of wood reaching to a
central octagonal lantern, which rises much higher and shows externally
as well as internally. Unfortunately, this vault is of wood, and would
require important modifications of detail if carried out in stone. But
it is so noble in general design and total effect, that one wonders the
type was not universally adopted for the crossing in all cathedrals,
until one observes that no cathedral of importance was built after
Walsingham’s time, nor did any other central towers opportunely fall to
the ground.</p>

FIG. 132.&mdash;CLOISTERS, SALISBURY CATHEDRAL (SHOWING UPPER PART OF
CHAPTER-HOUSE).</p>

<p><b>WINDOWS AND TRACERY.</b> In the Early English Period
(1200&ndash;1280 or 1300) the windows were tall and narrow
(<i>lancet</i> windows), and generally grouped by twos and threes,
though sometimes four and even five are seen together (as
<span class = "pagenum">225</span>
<a name = "page225" id = "page225"> </a>
the “Five Sisters” in the N.&nbsp;transept of York). In the nave of
Salisbury and the retro-choir of Ely the side aisles are lighted by
coupled windows and the clearstory by triple windows, the central one
higher than the others&mdash;a&nbsp;surviving Norman practice.
Plate-tracery was, as in France, an intermediate step leading to the
development of bar-tracery (see <a href = "#fig110">Fig.&nbsp;110</a>).
The English followed here the same reasoning as the French. At first the
openings constituted the design, the intervening stonework being of
secondary importance. Later the forms of the openings were subordinated
to the pattern of the stone framework of bars, arches, circles, and
cusps. Bar-tracery of this description prevailed in England through the
greater part of the Decorated Period (1280&ndash;1380), and somewhat
resembled the contemporary French geometric tracery, though more varied
and less rigidly constructive in design. An early example of this
tracery occurs in the cloisters of Salisbury (Fig. 132); others in the
clearstories of the choirs of Lichfield, Lincoln, and Ely, the nave of
York, and the chapter-houses mentioned above, where, indeed, it seems to
have received its earliest development. After the middle of the
fourteenth century lines of double curvature were introduced, producing
what is called <i>flowing</i> tracery, somewhat resembling the French
flamboyant, though earlier in date (<a href =
"#fig111">Fig.&nbsp;111</a>). Examples of this style are found in Wells,
in the side aisles and triforium of the choir of Ely, and in the
S.&nbsp;transept rose-window of Lincoln.</p>

FIG. 133.&mdash;PERPENDICULAR TRACERY, WEST WINDOW OF ST. GEORGE’S,
WINDSOR.<!-- invisible . --></p>

<p><b>THE PERPENDICULAR STYLE.</b> Flowing tracery was, however,
a&nbsp;transitional phase of design, and was soon superseded by
<i>Perpendicular</i> tracery, in which the mullions were
<span class = "pagenum">226</span>
<a name = "page226" id = "page226"> </a>
carried through to the top of the arch and intersected by horizontal
transoms. This formed a very rigid and mechanically correct system of
stone framing, but lacked the grace and charm of the two preceding
periods. The earliest examples are seen in the work of Edington and of
Wykeham in the reconstructed cathedral of Winchester (1360&ndash;1394),
where the tracery was thus made to harmonize with the accentuated and
multiplied vertical lines of the interior design. It was at this late
date that the English seem first to have fully appropriated the Gothic
ideas of emphasized vertical elements and wall surfaces reduced to a
minimum. The development of fan-vaulting had led to the adoption of a
new form of arch, the four-centred or <i>Tudor arch</i> (Fig. 133), to
fit under the depressed apex of the vault. The whole design internally
and externally was thenceforward controlled by the form of the vaulting
and of the openings. The windows were made of enormous size, especially
at the east end of the choir, which was square in nearly all English
churches, and in the west windows over the entrance. These windows had
already reached, in the Decorated Period, an enormous size, as at York;
in the Perpendicular Period the two ends of the
<span class = "pagenum">227</span>
<a name = "page227" id = "page227"> </a>
church were as nearly as possible converted into walls of glass. The
East Window of Gloucester reaches the prodigious dimensions of 38 by 72
feet. The most complete examples of the Perpendicular tracery and of the
style in general are the three chapels already mentioned (<a href =
"#page223">p.&nbsp;223</a>); those, namely, of <b>King’s College</b> at
Cambridge, of <b>St. George</b> at Windsor, and of <b>Henry VII.</b> in
Westminster Abbey.</p>


<p><b>CONSTRUCTIVE DESIGN.</b> The most striking peculiarity of English
Gothic design was its studious avoidance of temerity or venturesomeness
in construction. Both the height and width of the nave were kept within
very moderate bounds, and the supports were never reduced to extreme
slenderness. While much impressiveness of effect was undoubtedly lost
thereby, there was some gain in freedom of design, and there was less
obtrusion of constructive elements in the exterior composition. The
flying-buttress became a feature of minor importance where the
clearstory was kept low, as in most English churches. In many cases the
flying arches were hidden under the aisle roofs. The English cathedrals
and larger churches are long and low, depending for effect mainly upon
the projecting masses of their transepts, the imposing square central
towers which commonly crown the crossing, and the grouping of the main
structure with chapter-houses, cloisters, and Lady-chapels.</p>

FIG. 134.&mdash;WEST FRONT, LICHFIELD CATHEDRAL.</p>

<p><b>FRONTS.</b> The sides and east ends were, in most cases, more
successful than the west fronts. In these the English displayed a
singular indifference or lack of creative power. They produced nothing
to rival the majestic façades of Notre Dame, Amiens, or Reims, and their
portals are almost ridiculously small. The front of <b>York</b>
Cathedral is the most notable in the list for its size and elaborate
decoration. Those of <b>Lincoln</b> and <b>Peterborough</b> are,
however, more interesting in the picturesqueness and singularity of
their composition. The first-named forms a vast arcaded
<span class = "pagenum">228</span>
<a name = "page228" id = "page228"> </a>
screen, masking the bases of the two western towers, and pierced by
three huge Norman arches, retained from the original façade. The west
front of Peterborough is likewise a mask or screen, mainly composed of
three colossal recessed arches, whose vast scale completely dwarfs the
little porches which give admittance to the church. Salisbury has a
curiously illogical and ineffective façade. Those of <b>Lichfield</b>
and <b>Wells</b> are, on the other hand, imposing and beautiful designs,
the first with its twin spires and rich arcading (Fig. 134), the second
with its unusual wealth of figure-sculpture, and massive square
towers.</p>


<p><b>CENTRAL TOWERS.</b> These are the most successful features of
English exterior design. Most of them form lanterns internally over the
crossing, giving to that point a considerable increase of dignity.
Externally they are usually massive and lofty square towers, and having
been for the most part completed during the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries they are marked by great richness and elegance of detail.
Durham, York, Ely, Canterbury, Lincoln, and Gloucester maybe mentioned
as notable examples of such square towers; that of Canterbury is the
finest. Two or three have lofty spires over the lantern. Among these,
that of Salisbury is chief, rising 424 feet from the ground, admirably
designed in every
<span class = "pagenum">229</span>
<a name = "page229" id = "page229"> </a>
detail. It was not completed till the middle of the fourteenth century,
but most fortunately carries out with great felicity the spirit of the
earlier style in which it was begun. Lichfield and Chichester have
somewhat similar central spires, but less happy in proportion and detail
than the beautiful Salisbury example.</p>

<p class = "illustration float w180">

FIG. 135.&mdash;ONE BAY OF CHOIR, LICHFIELD CATHEDRAL.</p>


<p><b>INTERIOR DESIGN.</b> In the Norman churches the pier-arches,
triforium, and clearstory were practically equal. In the Gothic churches
the pier-arches generally occupy the lower half of the height, the upper
half being divided nearly equally between the triforium and clearstory,
as in Lincoln, Lichfield (nave), Ely (choir). In some cases, however (as
at Salisbury, Westminster, Winchester, choir of Lichfield), the
clearstory is magnified at the expense of the triforium (Fig. 135).
Three peculiarities of design sharply distinguish the English treatment
of these features from the French. The first is the multiplicity of fine
mouldings in the pier-arches; the second is the decorative elaboration
of design in the triforium; the third, the variety in the treatment of
the clearstory.<!-- invisible . --> In general the English interiors are
much more ornate than the French. Black Purbeck marble is frequently
used for the shafts clustered around the central core of the pier,
giving a striking and somewhat singular effect of contrasted color. The
rich vaulting, the highly decorated triforium, the moulded pier-arches,
and at the
<span class = "pagenum">230</span>
<a name = "page230" id = "page230"> </a>
end of the vista the great east window, produce an impression very
different from the more simple and lofty stateliness of the French
cathedrals. The great length and lowness of the English interiors
combine with this decorative richness to give the impression of repose
and grace, rather than of majesty and power. This tendency reached its
highest expression in the Perpendicular churches and chapels, in which
every surface was covered with minute panelling.</p>


<p><b>CARVING.</b> In the Early English Period the details were carved
with a combined delicacy and vigor deserving of the highest praise. In
the capitals and corbels, crockets and finials, the foliage was crisp
and fine, curling into convex masses and seeming to spring from the
surface which it decorated. Mouldings were frequently ornamented with
foliage of this character in the hollows, and another ornament, the
<i>dog-tooth</i> or <i>pyramid</i>, often served the same purpose,
introducing repeated points of light into the shadows of the mouldings.
These were fine and complex, deep hollows alternating with round
mouldings (<i>bowtels</i>) sometimes made pear-shaped in section by a
fillet on one side. <i>Cusping</i>&mdash;the decoration of an arch or
circle by triangular projections on its inner edge&mdash;was introduced
during this period, and became an important decorative resource,
especially in tracery design. In the Decorated Period the foliage was
less crisp; sea-weed and oak-leaves, closely and confusedly bunched,
were used in the capitals, while crockets were larger, double-curved,
with leaves swelling into convexities like oak-galls. Geometrical and
flowing tracery were developed, and the mouldings of the tracery-bars,
as of other features, lost somewhat in vigor and sharpness. The
<i>ball-flower</i> or button replaced the dog’s-tooth, and the hollows
were less frequently adorned with foliage.</p>

<p>In the Perpendicular Period nearly all flat surfaces were panelled in
designs resembling the tracery of the windows.
<span class = "pagenum">231</span>
<a name = "page231" id = "page231"> </a>
The capitals were less important than those of the preceding periods,
and the mouldings weaker and less effective. The Tudor rose appears as
an ornament in square panels and on flat surfaces; and moulded
battlements, which first appeared in Decorated work, now become a
frequent crowning motive in place of a cornice. There is less
originality and variety in the ornament, but a great increase in its
amount (Fig. 136).</p>

FIG. 136.&mdash;FAN-VAULTING, HENRY VII.’S CHAPEL, WESTMINSTER
ABBEY.</p>


<p><b>PLANS.</b> English church plans underwent, during the Gothic
Period, but little change from the general types established previous to
the thirteenth century. The Gothic cathedrals and abbeys, like the
Norman, were very long and narrow, with choirs often nearly as long as
the nave, and almost invariably with square eastward terminations. There
is no example of double side aisles and side chapels, and apsidal
chapels are very rare. Canterbury and Westminster (Fig. 137) are the
chief exceptions to this, and both show clearly the French influence.
Another striking peculiarity of the English plans is the frequent
occurrence of secondary
<span class = "pagenum">232</span>
<a name = "page232" id = "page232"> </a>
transepts, adding greatly to the external picturesqueness. These occur
in rudimentary form in Canterbury, and at Durham the Chapel of the Nine
Altars, added 1242&ndash;1290 to the eastern end, forms in reality a
secondary transept. This feature is most perfectly developed in the
cathedral of Salisbury (<a href = "#fig128">Fig.&nbsp;128</a>), and
appears also at Lincoln, Worcester, Wells, and a few other examples. The
English cathedral plans are also distinguished by the retention or
incorporation of many conventual features, such as cloisters, libraries,
and halls, and by the grouping of chapter-houses and Lady-chapels with
the main edifice. Thus the English cathedral plans and those of the
great abbey churches present a marked contrast with those of France and
the Continent generally. While Amiens, the greatest of French
cathedrals, is 521 feet long, and internally 140 feet high, Ely measures
565 feet in length, and less than 75 feet in height. Notre Dame is 148
feet wide; the English naves are usually under 80 feet in total width of
the three aisles.</p>

<p><b>PARISH CHURCHES.</b> Many of these were of exceptional beauty of
composition and detail. They display the greatest variety of plan,
churches with two equal-gabled naves
<span class = "pagenum">233</span>
<a name = "page233" id = "page233"> </a>
side by side being not uncommon. A&nbsp;considerable proportion of them
date from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and are chiefly
interesting for their square, single, west towers and their carved
wooden ceilings (see below). The tower was usually built over the
central western porch; broad and square, with corner buttresses
terminating in pinnacles, it was usually finished without spires.
Crenelated battlements crowned the upper story. When spires were added
the transition from the square tower to the octagonal spire was effected
by <i>broaches</i> or portions of a square pyramid intersecting the base
of the spire, or by corner pinnacles and flying-buttresses.</p>

FIG. 138.&mdash;ROOF OF NAVE, ST.&nbsp;MARY’S, WESTONZOYLAND.</p>

<p><b>WOODEN CEILINGS.</b> The English treated woodwork with consummate
skill. They invented and developed a variety of forms of roof-truss in
which the proper distribution of the strains was combined with a highly
decorative treatment of the several parts by carving, moulding, and
arcading. The ceiling surfaces between the trusses were handled
decoratively, and the oaken open-timber ceilings of many of the English
churches and civic or academic halls (Christ Church Hall, Oxford;
Westminster Hall, London) are such noble and beautiful works as quite to
justify the substitution of wooden for vaulted ceilings (Fig. 138). The
<i>hammer-beam</i> truss was in its way as highly scientific, and
æsthetically as satisfactory, as any feature of French Gothic
<span class = "pagenum">234</span>
<a name = "page234" id = "page234"> </a>
stone construction. Without the use of tie-rods to keep the rafters from
spreading, it brought the strain of the roof upon internal brackets low
down on the wall, and produced a beautiful effect by the repetition of
its graceful curves in each truss.</p>


<p><b>CHAPELS AND HALLS.</b> Many of these rival the cathedrals in
beauty and dignity of design. The royal chapels at Windsor and
Westminster have already been mentioned, as well as King’s College
Chapel at Cambridge, and Christ Church Hall at Oxford. To these college
halls should be added the chapel of Merton College at Oxford, and the
beautiful chapel of St. Stephen at Westminster, most unfortunately
demolished when the present Parliament House was erected. The
Lady-chapels of Gloucester and Ely, though connected with the
cathedrals, are really independent designs of late date, and remarkable
for the richness of their decoration, their great windows, and elaborate
ribbed vaulting. Some of the halls in mediæval castles and manor-houses
are also worthy of note, especially for their timber ceilings.</p>


<p><b>MINOR MONUMENTS.</b> The student of Gothic architecture should
also give attention to the choir-screens, tombs, and chantries which
embellish many of the abbeys and cathedrals. The rood-screen at York is
a notable example of the first; the tomb of De Gray in the same
cathedral, and tombs and chantries in Canterbury, Winchester,
Westminster Abbey, Ely, St. Alban’s Abbey, and other churches are
deservedly admired. In these the English love for ornament, for minute
carving, and for the contrast of white and colored marble, found
unrestrained expression. To these should be added the market-crosses of
Salisbury and Winchester, and Queen Eleanor’s Cross at Waltham.</p>


<p><b>DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE.</b> The mediæval castles of Great Britain
belong to the domain of military engineering rather than of the history
of art, though occasionally presenting
<span class = "pagenum">235</span>
<a name = "page235" id = "page235"> </a>
to view details of considerable architectural beauty. The growth of
peace and civic order is marked by the erection of manor-houses, the
residences of wealthy landowners. Some of these houses are of imposing
size, and show the application to domestic requirements, of the late
Gothic style which prevailed in the period to which most of them belong.
The windows are square or Tudor-arched, with stone mullions and transoms
of the Perpendicular style, and the walls terminate in merlons or
crenelated parapets, recalling the earlier military structures. The
palace of the bishop or archbishop, adjoining the cathedral, and the
residences of the dean, canons, and clergy, together with the libraries,
schools, and gates of the cathedral enclosure, illustrate other phases
of secular Gothic work. Few of these structures are of striking
architectural merit, but they possess a picturesque charm which is very
attractive.</p>

<p>Not many stone houses of the smaller class remain from the Gothic
period in England. But there is hardly an old town that does not retain
many of the half-timbered dwellings of the fifteenth or even fourteenth
century, some of them in excellent preservation. They are for the most
part wider and lower than the French houses of the same class, but are
built on the same principle, and, like them, the woodwork is more or
less richly carved.</p>

<p><b>EARLY GOTHIC WORKS.</b> The Gothic architecture of Germany is less
interesting to the general student than that of France and England, not
only because its development was less systematic and more provincial,
but also because it produced fewer works of high intrinsic merit. The
introduction into Germany of the pointed style was tardy, and its
progress slow. Romanesque architecture had created imposing types of
ecclesiastical architecture, which the conservative Teutons were slow to
abandon. The result was a half-century of transition and a mingling of
Romanesque and Gothic forms. St. Castor, at Coblentz, built as late as
1208, is wholly Romanesque. Even when the pointed arch and vault had
finally come into general use, the plan and the constructive system
still remained predominantly Romanesque. The western apse and short
sanctuary of the earlier plans were retained. There was no triforium,
the
<span class = "pagenum">238</span>
<a name = "page238" id = "page238"> </a>
clearstory was insignificant, and the whole aspect low and massive. The
Germans avoided, at first, as did the English, the constructive
audacities and difficulties of the French Gothic, but showed less of
invention and grace than their English neighbors. When, however, through
the influence of foreign models, especially of the great French
cathedrals, and through the employment of foreign architects, the Gothic
styles were at last thoroughly domesticated, a&nbsp;spirit of
ostentation took the place of the earlier conservatism. Technical
cleverness, exaggerated ingenuity of detail, and constructive <i>tours
de force</i> characterize most of the German Gothic work of the late
fourteenth and of the fifteenth century. This is exemplified in the
slender mullions of Ulm, the lofty and complicated spire of Strasburg,
and the curious traceries of churches and houses in Nuremberg.</p>


<p><b>PERIODS.</b> The periods of German mediæval architecture
corresponded in sequence, though not in date, with the movement
elsewhere. The maturing of the true Gothic styles was preceded by more
than a half-century of transition. Chronologically the periods may be
broadly stated as follows:</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Transitional</span>,
1170&ndash;1225.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Early Pointed</span>,
1225&ndash;1275.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Middle or Decorated</span>,
1275&ndash;1350.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Florid</span>, 1350&ndash;1530.</p>

<p>These divisions are, however, far less clearly defined than in France
and England. The development of forms was less logical and
consequential, and less uniform in the different provinces, than in
those western lands.</p>

FIG. 139.&mdash;ONE BAY OF CATHEDRAL OF ST. GEORGE, LIMBURG.</p>

<p><b>CONSTRUCTION.</b> As already remarked, a&nbsp;tenacious hold of
Romanesque methods is observable in many German Gothic monuments. Broad
wall-surfaces with small windows and a general massiveness and lowness
of proportions were long preferred to the more slender and lofty forms
of true
<span class = "pagenum">239</span>
<a name = "page239" id = "page239"> </a>
Gothic design. Square vaulting-bays were persistently adhered to,
covering two aisle-bays. The six-part system was only rarely resorted
to, as at Schlettstadt, and in St. George at Limburg-on-the-Lahn (Fig.
139). The ribbed vault was an imported idea, and was never
systematically developed. Under the final dominance of French models in
the second half of the thirteenth century, vaulting in oblong bays
became more general, powerfully influenced by buildings like Freiburg,
Cologne, Oppenheim, and Ratisbon cathedrals. In the fourteenth century
the growing taste for elaboration and rich detail led to the
introduction of multiplied decorative ribs. These, however, did not come
into use, as in England, through a logical development of constructive
methods, but purely as decorative features. The German multiple-ribbed
vaulting is, therefore, less satisfying than the English, though often
elegant. Conspicuous examples of its application are found in the
cathedrals of Freiburg, Ulm, Prague, and Vienna; in St. Barbara at
Kuttenberg, and many other important churches. But with all the richness
and complexity of these net-like vaults the Germans developed nothing
like the fan-vaulting or chapter-house ceilings of England.</p>


<p><b>SIDE AISLES.</b> The most notable structural innovation of the
Germans was the raising of the side aisles to the same height as the
central aisle in a number of important
<span class = "pagenum">240</span>
<a name = "page240" id = "page240"> </a>
churches. They thus created a distinctly new type, to which German
writers have given the name of <i>hall-church</i>. The result of this
innovation was to transform completely the internal perspective of the
church, as well as its structural membering. The clearstory disappeared;
the central aisle no longer dominated the interior; the pier-arches and
side-walls were greatly increased in height, and flying buttresses were
no longer required. The whole design appeared internally more spacious,
but lost greatly in variety and in interest. The cathedral of <b>St.
Stephen</b> at Vienna is the most imposing instance of this treatment,
which first appeared in the church of St. Elizabeth at Marburg
(1235&ndash;83; Fig. 140). St. Barbara at Kuttenberg, St. Martin’s at
Landshut (1404), and the cathedral of Munich are others among many
examples of this type.</p>

FIG. 140.&mdash;SECTION OF ST. ELIZABETH, MARBURG.</p>


<p><b>TOWERS AND SPIRES.</b> The same fondness for spires which had been
displayed in the Rhenish Romanesque churches produced in the Gothic
period a number of strikingly beautiful church steeples, in which
openwork tracery was substituted for the solid stone pyramids of earlier
examples. The most remarkable of these spires are those of Freiburg
(1300), Strasburg, and Cologne cathedrals, of the church at Esslingen,
St. Martin’s at Landshut, and the cathedral of Vienna. In these the
transition from the simple square tower below to the octagonal belfry
and spire is generally managed with skill. In the remarkable tower of
the cathedral
<span class = "pagenum">241</span>
<a name = "page241" id = "page241"> </a>
at Vienna (1433) the transition is too gradual, so that the spire seems
to start from the ground and lacks the vigor and accent of a simpler
square lower portion. The over-elaborate spire of <b>Strasburg</b>
(1429, by Junckher of Cologne; lower parts and façade, 1277&ndash;1365,
by <i>Erwin von Steinbach</i> and his sons) reaches a height of 468
feet; the spires of Cologne, completed in 1883 from the original
fourteenth-century drawings, long lost but recovered by a happy
accident, are 500 feet high. The spires of <b>Ratisbon</b> and
<b>Ulm</b> cathedrals have also been recently completed in the original
style.</p>


<p><b>DETAILS.</b> German window tracery was best where it most closely
followed French patterns, but it tended always towards the faults of
mechanical stiffness and of technical display in over-slenderness of
shafts and mullions. The windows, especially in the “hall-churches,”
were apt to be too narrow for their height. In the fifteenth century
ingenuity of geometrical combinations took the place of grace of line,
and later the tracery was often tortured into a stone caricature of
rustic-work of interlaced and twisted boughs and twigs, represented with
all their bark and knots (<i>branch-tracery</i>). The execution was far
superior to the design. The carving of foliage in capitals, finials,
etc., calls for no special mention for its originality or its departure
from French types.</p>

FIG. 141.&mdash;COLOGNE CATHEDRAL. PLAN.</p>

<p><b>PLANS.</b> In these there was more variety than in any other part
of Europe except Italy. Some churches, like Naumburg, retained the
Romanesque system of a second western apse and short choir. The
Cistercian churches generally had square east ends, while the polygonal
eastern apse without ambulatory is seen in St. Elizabeth at Marburg, the
cathedrals of Ratisbon, Ulm and Vienna, and many other churches. The
introduction of French ideas in the thirteenth century led to the
adoption in a number of cases of the chevet with a single ambulatory and
a series of
<span class = "pagenum">242</span>
<a name = "page242" id = "page242"> </a>
radiating apsidal chapels. <b>Magdeburg</b> cathedral (1208&ndash;11)
was the first erected on this plan, which was later followed at
Altenburg, Cologne, Freiburg, Lübeck, Prague and Zwettl, in St. Francis
at Salzburg and some other churches. Side chapels to nave or choir
appear in the cathedrals of Lübeck, Munich, Oppenheim, Prague and
Zwettl. <b>Cologne</b> <b>Cathedral</b>, by far the largest and most
magnificent of all, is completely French in plan, uniting in one design
the leading characteristics of the most notable French churches (Fig.
141). It has complete double aisles in both nave and choir, three-aisled
transepts, radial chevet-chapels and twin western towers. The ambulatory
is, however, single, and there are no lateral chapels. A&nbsp;typical
German treatment was the eastward termination of the church by polygonal
chapels, one in the axis of each aisle, the central one projecting
beyond its neighbors. Where there were five aisles, as at Xanten, the
effect was particularly fine. The plan of the curious polygonal church
of <b>Our Lady</b> (Liebfrauenkirche; 1227&ndash;43) built on the site
of the ancient circular baptistery at Treves, would seem to have been
produced by doubling such an arrangement on either side of the
transverse axis (Fig. 142).</p>

<p><b>HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT.</b> The so-called <b>Golden Portal</b> of
<b>Freiburg</b> in the Erzgebirge is perhaps the first distinctively
Gothic work in Germany, dating from 1190. From that time on, Gothic
details appeared with increasing frequency, especially in the Rhine
provinces, as shown in many
<span class = "pagenum">243</span>
<a name = "page243" id = "page243"> </a>
transitional structures. <b>Gelnhausen</b> and Aschaffenburg are early
13th-century examples; pointed arches and vaults appear in the Apostles’
and St. Martin’s churches at Cologne; and the great church of <b>St.
Peter and St. Paul</b> at Neuweiler in Alsace has an almost purely
Gothic nave of the same period. The churches of <b>Bamberg</b>,
<b>Fritzlar</b>, and <b>Naumburg</b>, and in Westphalia those of
<b>Münster</b> and <b>Osnabrück</b>, are important examples of the
transition. The French influence, especially the Burgundian, appears as
early as 1212 in the cathedral of Magdeburg, imitating the choir of
Soissons, and in the structural design of the Liebfrauenkirche at Treves
as already mentioned; it reached complete ascendancy in Alsace at
<b>Strasburg</b> (nave 1240&ndash;75), in Baden at <b>Freiburg</b> (nave
1270) and in Prussia at <b>Cologne</b> (1248&ndash;1320). Strasburg
Cathedral is especially remarkable for its façade, the work of Erwin von
Steinbach and his sons (1277&ndash;1346), designed after French models,
and its north spire, built in the fifteenth century. Cologne Cathedral,
begun in 1248 by <i>Gerhard of Riel</i> in imitation of the newly
completed choir of Amiens, was continued by Master <i>Arnold</i> and his
son <i>John</i>, and the choir was consecrated in 1322. The nave and
W.&nbsp;front were built during the first half of the 14th century,
though the towers were not completed till 1883.

FIG. 143.<!-- invisible . -->&mdash;PLAN OF<br>
ULM CATHEDRAL.</span>
In spite of its vast size and slow construction, it is in style the most
uniform of all great Gothic cathedrals, as it is the most lofty
(excepting the choir of Beauvais) and the largest excepting Milan and
<span class = "pagenum">244</span>
<a name = "page244" id = "page244"> </a>
Seville. Unfortunately its details, though pure and correct, are
singularly dry and mechanical, while its very uniformity deprives it of
the picturesque and varied charm which results from a mixture of styles
recording the labors of successive generations. The same criticism may
be raised against the late cathedral of <b>Ulm</b> (choir,
1377&ndash;1449; nave, 1477; Fig. 143). The Cologne influence is
observable in the widely separated cathedrals of Utrecht in the
Netherlands, Metz in the W., Minden and <b>Halberstadt</b> (begun 1250;
mainly built after 1327) in Saxony, and in the S. in the church of
<b>St. Catherine</b> at Oppenheim. To the E. and&nbsp;S., in the
cathedrals of <b>Prague</b> (Bohemia) by <i>Matthew of Arras</i>
(1344&ndash;52) and <b>Ratisbon</b> (or Regensburg, 1275) the French
influence predominates, at least in the details and construction. The
last-named is one of the most dignified and beautiful of German Gothic
churches&mdash;German in plan, French in execution. The French influence
also manifests itself in the details of many of the peculiarly German
churches with aisles of equal height (see <a href =
"#page240">p.&nbsp;240</a>).</p>

<p>More peculiarly German are the brick churches of North Germany, where
stone was almost wholly lacking. In these, flat walls, square towers,
and decoration by colored tiles and bricks are characteristic, as at
Brandenburg (St. Godehard and <b>St. Catherine</b>, 1346&ndash;1400), at
<b>Prentzlau</b>, Tängermünde, Königsberg, &amp;c. Lübeck possesses
notable monuments of brick architecture in the churches of <b>St.
Mary</b> and St. Catherine, both much alike in plan and in the flat and
barren simplicity of their exteriors. <b>St. Martin’s</b> at
<b>Landshut</b> in the South is also a notable brick church.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">245</span>
<a name = "page245" id = "page245"> </a>
<p><b>LATE GOTHIC.</b> As in France and England, the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries were mainly occupied with the completion of existing
churches, many of which, up to that time, were still without naves. The
works of this period show the exaggerated attenuation of detail already
alluded to, though their richness and elegance sometimes atone for their
mechanical character. The complicated ribbed vaults of this period are
among its most striking features (see <a href =
"#page239">p.&nbsp;239</a>). Spire-building was as general as was the
erection of central square towers in England, during the same period. To
this time also belong the overloaded traceries and minute detail of the
<b>St. Sebald</b> and St. Lorenz churches and of several secular
buildings at Nuremberg, the façade of Chemnitz Cathedral, and similar
works. The nave and tower of St. Stephen at Vienna (1359&ndash;1433),
the church of Sta. Maria in Gestade in the same city, and the cathedral
of Kaschau in Hungary, are Austrian masterpieces of late Gothic
design.</p>


<p><b>SECULAR BUILDINGS.</b> Germany possesses a number of important
examples of secular Gothic work, chiefly municipal buildings (gates and
town halls) and castles. The first completely Gothic castle or palace
was not built until 1280, at <b>Marienburg</b> (Prussia), and was
completed a century later. It consists of two courts, the earlier of the
two forming a closed square and containing the chapel and chapter-house
of the Order of the German knights. The later and larger court is less
regular, its chief feature being the <b>Great Hall</b> of the Order, in
two aisles. All the vaulting is of the richest multiple-ribbed type.
Other castles are at Marienwerder, Heilsberg (1350) in E.&nbsp;Prussia,
Karlstein in Bohemia (1347), and the <b>Albrechtsburg</b> at Meissen in
Saxony (1471&ndash;83).</p>

<p>Among town halls, most of which date from the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries may be mentioned those of Ratisbon (Regensburg),
Münster and Hildesheim, Halberstadt,
<span class = "pagenum">246</span>
<a name = "page246" id = "page246"> </a>
<b>Brunswick</b>, Lübeck, and Bremen&mdash;the last two of brick. These,
and the city gates, such as the <b>Spahlenthor</b> at Basle
(Switzerland) and others at Lübeck and Wismar, are generally very
picturesque edifices. Many fine guildhalls were also built during the
last two centuries of the Gothic style; and dwelling-houses of the same
period, of quaint and effective design, with stepped or traceried
gables, lofty roofs, openwork balconies and corner turrets, are to be
found in many cities. Nuremberg is especially rich in these.</p>


<p><b>THE NETHERLANDS</b>, as might be expected from their position,
underwent the influences of both France and Germany. During the
thirteenth century, largely through the intimate monastic relations
between Tournay and Noyon, the French influence became paramount in what
is now Belgium, while Holland remained more strongly German in style. Of
the two countries Belgium developed by far the most interesting
architecture. Some of its cathedrals, notably those of Tournay, Antwerp,
Brussels, Malines (Mechlin), Mons and Louvain, rank high among
structures of their class, both in scale and in artistic treatment. The
Flemish town halls and guildhalls merit particular attention for their
size and richness, exemplifying in a worthy manner the wealth,
prosperity, and independence of the weavers and merchants of Antwerp,
Ypres, Ghent (Gand), Louvain, and other cities in the fifteenth
century.</p>


<p><b>CATHEDRALS AND CHURCHES.</b> The earliest purely Gothic edifice in
Belgium was the choir of <b>Ste. Gudule</b> (1225) at Brussels, followed
in 1242 by the choir and transepts of <b>Tournay</b>, designed with
pointed vaults, side chapels, and a complete <i>chevet</i>. The
transept-ends are round, as at Noyon. It was surpassed in splendor by
the <b>Cathedral</b> of <b>Antwerp</b> (1352&ndash;1422), remarkable for
its seven-aisled nave and narrow transepts. It covers some 70,000 square
feet, but its great size is not as effective internally as it should be,
owing to the poverty of the details and the lack
<span class = "pagenum">247</span>
<a name = "page247" id = "page247"> </a>
of finely felt proportion in the various parts. The late west front
(1422&ndash;1518) displays the florid taste of the wealthy Flemish
burgher population of that period, but is so rich and elegant,
especially its lofty and slender north spire, that its over-decoration
is pardonable. The cathedral of <b>St. Rombaut</b> at Malines (choir,
1366; nave, 1454&ndash;64) is a more satisfactory church, though smaller
and with its western towers incomplete. The cathedral of <b>Louvain</b>
belongs to the same period (1373&ndash;1433). <b>St. Wandru</b> at Mons
(1450&ndash;1528) and <b>St. Jacques</b> at Liège (1522&ndash;58) are
interesting parish churches of the first rank, remarkable especially for
the use of color in their internal decoration, for their late tracery
and ribbed vaulting, and for the absence of Renaissance details at that
late period.</p>


<p><b>TOWN HALLS: GUILDHALLS.</b> These were really the most
characteristic Flemish edifices, and are in most cases the most
conspicuous monuments of their respective cities. The <b>Cloth Hall</b>
of <b>Ypres</b> (1304) is the earliest and most imposing among them;
similar halls were built not much later at <b>Bruges</b>,
<b>Louvain</b>, <b>Malines</b> and <b>Ghent</b>. The town halls were
mostly of later date, the earliest being that of <b>Bruges</b> (1377).
The town halls of <b>Brussels</b> with its imposing
<span class = "pagenum">248</span>
<a name = "page248" id = "page248"> </a>
and graceful tower, of <b>Louvain</b> (1448&ndash;63; Fig. 144) and of
<b>Oudenärde</b> (early 16th century) are conspicuous monuments of this
class.</p>

<p>In general, the Gothic architecture of Belgium presents the traits of
a borrowed style, which did not undergo at the hands of its borrowers
any radically novel or fundamental development. The structural design is
usually lacking in vigor and organic significance, but the details are
often graceful and well designed, especially on the exterior. The
tendency was often towards over-elaboration, particularly in the later
works.</p>

<p>The Gothic architecture of <b>Holland</b> and of the
<b>Scandinavian</b> countries offers so little that is highly artistic
or inspiring in character, that space cannot well be given in this work,
even to an enumeration of its chief monuments.</p>


<p><b>SPAIN AND PORTUGAL.</b> The beginnings of Gothic architecture in
Spain followed close on the series of campaigns from 1217 to 1252, which
began the overthrow of the Moorish dominion. With the resulting spirit
of exultation and the wealth accruing from booty, came a rapid
development of architecture, mainly under French influence. Gothic
architecture was at this date, under St. Louis, producing in France some
of its noblest works. The great cathedrals of <b>Toledo</b> and
<b>Burgos</b>, begun between 1220 and 1230, were the earliest purely
Gothic churches in Spain. <b>San Vincente</b> at Avila and the <b>Old
Cathedral</b> at Salamanca, of somewhat earlier date, present a mixture
of round- and pointed-arched forms, with the Romanesque elements
predominant. <b>Toledo Cathedral</b>, planned in imitation of Notre Dame
and Bourges, but exceeding them in width, covers 75,000 square feet, and
thus ranks among the largest of European cathedrals. Internally it is
well proportioned and well detailed, recalling the early French
masterworks, but its exterior is less commendable.</p>

FIG. 145.<!-- invisible both . -->&mdash;FAÇADE OF BURGOS CATHEDRAL.</p>

<p>In the contemporary cathedral of Burgos the exterior is at least as
interesting as the interior. The west front, of German design, suggests
Cologne by its twin openwork spires (Fig. 145); while the crossing is
embellished with a sumptuous dome and lantern or <i>cimborio</i>, added
as late as 1567. The chapels at the east end, especially that of the
Condestabile (1487), are ornate to the point of overloading,
a&nbsp;fault to which late Spanish Gothic work is peculiarly prone.
Other thirteenth-century cathedrals are those of <b>Leon</b> (1260),
<b>Valencia</b> (1262), and <b>Barcelona</b> (1298), all exhibiting
strongly the French influence in the plan, vaulting, and vertical
proportions. The models of Bourges and Paris with their wide naves,
lateral chapels and semicircular chevets were followed in the cathedral
of Barcelona, in a number of fourteenth-century churches both there and
elsewhere, and in the sixteenth-century cathedral of Segovia. In Sta.
Maria del Pi at Barcelona, in the collegiate church at Manresa, and in
the imposing nave of the <b>Cathedral</b> of <b>Gerona</b> (1416, added
to choir of 1312, the latter by a Southern French architect, Henri de
Narbonne), the influence of Alby in southern France (see <a href =
"#page206">p.&nbsp;206</a>) is discernible. These are one-aisled
churches with internal
<span class = "pagenum">250</span>
<a name = "page250" id = "page250"> </a>
buttresses separating the lateral chapels. The nave of Gerona is 73 feet
wide, or double the average clear width of French or English cathedral
naves. The resulting effect is not commensurate with the actual
dimensions, and shows the inappropriateness of Gothic details for
compositions so Roman in breadth and simplicity.</p>


<p><b>SEVILLE.</b> The largest single edifice in Spain, and the largest
church built during the Middle Ages in Europe, is the <b>Cathedral of
Seville</b>, begun in 1401 on the site of a Moorish mosque. It covers
124,000 square feet, measuring 415 × 298 feet, and is a simple rectangle
comprising five aisles with lateral chapels. The central aisle is 56 ft.
wide and 145 high; the side aisles and chapels diminish gradually in
height, and with the uniform piers in six rows produce an imposing
effect, in spite of the lack of transepts or chevet. The somewhat
similar <b>New Cathedral</b> of Salamanca (1510&ndash;1560) shows the
last struggles of the Gothic style against the incoming tide of the
Renaissance.</p>


<p><b>LATER MONUMENTS.</b> These all partake of the over-decoration
which characterized the fifteenth century throughout Europe. In Spain
this decoration was even less constructive in character, and more purely
fanciful and arbitrary, than in the northern lands; but this very
rejection of all constructive pretense gives it a peculiar charm and
goes far to excuse its extravagance (Fig. 146). Decorative vaulting-ribs
were made to describe geometric patterns of great elegance. Some of the
late Gothic vaults by the very exuberance of imagination shown in their
designs, almost disarm criticism. Instead of suppressing the walls as
far as possible, and emphasizing all the vertical lines, as was done in
France and England, the later Gothic architects of Spain delighted in
broad wall-surfaces and multiplied horizontal lines. Upon these surfaces
they lavished carving without restraint and without any organic relation
to the structure of the building. The arcades of
<span class = "pagenum">251</span>
<a name = "page251" id = "page251"> </a>
cloisters and interior courts (<i>patios</i>) were formed with arches of
fantastic curves resting on twisted columns; and internal chapels in the
cathedrals were covered with minute carving of exquisite workmanship,
but wholly irrational design. Probably the influence of Moorish
decorative art accounts in part for these extravagances. The eastern
chapels in Burgos cathedral, the votive church of <b>San Juan de los
Reyes</b> at Toledo and many portals of churches, convents and hospitals
illustrate these tendencies.</p>

<p><b>PORTUGAL</b> is an almost unknown land architecturally. It seems
to have adopted the Gothic styles very late in its history. Two
monuments, however, are conspicuous, the convent churches of Batalha
(1390&ndash;1520) and <b>Belem</b>, both marked by an extreme
overloading of carved ornament. The <b>Mausoleum of King Manoel</b> in
the rear of the church at Batalha is, however, a&nbsp;noble creation,
possibly by an English master. It is a polygonal domed edifice, some 67
feet in diameter, and well

designed, though covered with a too profuse and somewhat mechanical
decoration of panels, pinnacles, and carving.</p>

<p><b>GENERAL CHARACTER.</b> The various Romanesque styles which had
grown up in Italy before 1200 lacked that unity of principle out of
which alone a new and homogeneous national style could have been
evolved. Each province practised its own style and methods of building,
long after the Romanesque had given place to the Gothic in Western
Europe. The Italians were better decorators than builders, and cared
little for Gothic structural principles. Mosaic and carving, sumptuous
altars and tombs, veneerings and inlays of colored marble, broad flat
surfaces to be covered with painting and ornament&mdash;to secure these
they were content to build crudely, to tie their insufficiently
buttressed vaults with unsightly iron tie-rods, and to make their church
façades mere screen-walls, in form wholly unrelated to the buildings
behind them.</p>

<p>When, therefore, under foreign influences pointed arches, tracery,
clustered shafts, crockets and finials came into use, it was merely as
an imported fashion. Even when foreign architects (usually Germans) were
employed, the
<span class = "pagenum">255</span>
<a name = "page255" id = "page255"> </a>
composition, and in large measure the details, were still Italian and
provincial. The church of St. Francis at Assisi (1228&ndash;53, by
<i>Jacobus of Meruan</i>, a&nbsp;German, superseded later by an Italian,
Campello), and the cathedral of Milan (begun 1389, perhaps by <i>Henry
of Gmund</i>), are conspicuous illustrations of this. Rome built
basilicas all through the Middle Ages. Tuscany continued to prefer flat
walls veneered with marble to the broken surfaces and deep buttresses of
France and Germany. Venice developed a Gothic style of façade-design
wholly her own (see <a href = "#page267">p.&nbsp;267</a>). Nowhere but
in Italy could two such utterly diverse structures as the Certosa at
Pavia and the cathedral at Milan have been erected at the same time.</p>


<p><b>CLIMATE AND TRADITION.</b> Two further causes militated against
the domestication of Gothic art in Italy. The first was the brilliant
atmosphere, which made the vast traceried windows of Gothic design, and
its suppression of the wall-surfaces, wholly undesirable. Cool, dim
interiors, thick walls, small windows and the exclusion of sunlight, all
necessary to Italian comfort, were incompatible with Gothic ideals and
methods. The second obstacle was the persistence of classic traditions
of form, both in construction and decoration. The spaciousness and
breadth of interior planning which characterized Roman design, and its
amplitude of scale in every feature, seem never to have lost their hold
on the Italians. The narrow lofty aisles, multiplied supports and minute
detail of the Gothic style were repugnant to the classic predilections
of the Italian builders. The Roman acanthus and Corinthian capital were
constantly imitated in their Gothic buildings, and the round arch
continued all through the Middle Ages to be used in conjunction with the
pointed arch (Figs. <a href = "#fig149">149</a>, <a href =
"#fig150">150</a>).</p>

<p><b>EARLY BUILDINGS.</b> It is hard to determine how and by whom
Gothic forms were first introduced into Italy, but it was most probably
through the agency of the monastic
<span class = "pagenum">256</span>
<a name = "page256" id = "page256"> </a>
orders. Cistercian churches like that at Chiaravalle near Milan
(1208&ndash;21), and most of those erected by the mendicant orders of
the Franciscans (founded 1210) and Dominicans (1216), were built with
ribbed vaults and pointed arches.<!-- invisible . --> The example set by
these orders contributed greatly to the general adoption of the foreign
style. <b>S.&nbsp;Francesco</b> at <b>Assisi</b>, already mentioned, was
the first completely Gothic Franciscan church, although
<b>S.&nbsp;Francesco</b> at <b>Bologna</b>, begun a few years later, was
finished a little earlier. The Dominican church of <b>SS. Giovanni e
Paolo</b> and the great Franciscan church of <b>Sta. Maria Gloriosa dei
Frari</b>, both at Venice, were built a little later. <b>Sta. Maria
Novella</b> at Florence (1278), and <b>Sta. Maria sopra Minerva</b> at
Rome (1280), both by the brothers <i>Sisto</i> and <i>Ristoro</i>, and
<b>S.&nbsp;Anastasia</b> at Verona (1261) are the masterpieces of the
Dominican builders.<!-- invisible . --> <b>S.&nbsp;Andrea</b> at
<b>Vercelli</b> in North Italy, begun in 1219 under a foreign architect,
is an isolated early example of lay Gothic work. Though somewhat English
in its plan, and (unlike most Italian churches) provided with two
western spires in the English manner, it is in all other respects
thoroughly Italian in aspect. The church at Asti, begun in 1229,
suggests German models by its high side walls and narrow windows.<!--

<p><b>CATHEDRALS.</b> The greatest monuments of Italian Gothic design
are the cathedrals, in which, even more than was the case in France, the
highly developed civic pride of the
<span class = "pagenum">257</span>
<a name = "page257" id = "page257"> </a>
municipalities expressed itself. Chief among these half civic, half
religious monuments are the cathedrals of <b>Sienna</b> (begun in 1243),
<b>Arezzo</b> (1278), <b>Orvieto</b> (1290), <b>Florence</b> (the
<b>Duomo</b>, Sta. Maria del Fiore, begun 1294 by Arnolfo di Cambio),
<b>Lucca</b> (S.&nbsp;Martino, 1350), <b>Milan</b> (1389&ndash;1418),
and <b>S.&nbsp;Petronio</b> at Bologna (1390).<!-- invisible . --> They
are all of imposing size; Milan is the largest of all Gothic cathedrals
except Seville.<!-- invisible . --> S.&nbsp;Petronio was planned to be
600 feet long, the present structure with its three broad aisles and
flanking chapels being merely the nave of the intended edifice. The
Duomo at Florence (Fig. 147) is 500 feet long and covers 82,000 square
feet, while the octagon at the crossing is 143 feet in diameter. The
effect of these colossal dimensions is, however, as in a number of these
large Italian interiors, singularly belittled by the bareness of the
walls, by the great size of the constituent parts of the composition,
and by the lack of architectural subdivisions and multiplied detail to
serve as a scale by which to gauge the scale of the <i>ensemble</i>.</p>

naves of extraordinary breadth,
<span class = "pagenum">258</span>
<a name = "page258" id = "page258"> </a>
with paintings and color decoration. This would have remedied their
present nakedness and lack of interest, but it was only in a very few
instances carried out. The double church of S.&nbsp;Francesco at Assisi,
decorated by Cimabue, Giotto, and other early Tuscan painters, the Arena
Chapel at Padua, painted by Giotto, the <b>Spanish Chapel</b> of
S.&nbsp;M. Novella, Florence, and the east end of S.&nbsp;Croce,
Florence, are illustrations of the splendor of effect possible by this
method of decoration. The bareness of effect in other, unpainted
interiors was emphasized by the plainness of the vaults destitute of
minor ribs. The transverse ribs were usually broad arches with flat
soffits, and the vaulting was often sprung from so low a point as to
leave no room for a triforium. Mere bull’s-eyes often served for
clearstory windows, as in S.&nbsp;Anastasia at Verona, S.&nbsp;Petronio
at Bologna, and the Florentine Duomo. The cathedral of
<b>S.&nbsp;Martino</b> at Lucca (Fig. 149) is one of the most complete
and elegant of Italian Gothic interiors, having a genuine triforium with
traceried arches. Even here, however, there are round arches without
mouldings, flat pilasters, broad transverse ribs recalling Roman arches,
and insignificant bull’s-eyes in the clearstory.</p>

FIG. 150.&mdash;INTERIOR OF SIENNA CATHEDRAL.</p>

<p>The failure to produce adequate results of scale in the interiors of
the larger Italian churches, has been already alluded to. It is
strikingly exemplified in the Duomo at Florence, the nave of which is 72
feet wide, with four pier-arches
<span class = "pagenum">259</span>
<a name = "page259" id = "page259"> </a>
each over 55 feet in span. The immense vault, in square bays, starts
from the level of the tops of these arches. The interior (Fig. 148) is
singularly naked and cold, giving no conception of its vast dimensions.
The colossal dome is an early work of the Renaissance (see <a href =
"arch2.html#page276">p.&nbsp;276</a>). It is not known how <i>Fr.
Talenti</i>, who in 1357 enlarged and vaulted the nave and planned the
east end, proposed to cover the great octagon. The east end is the most
effective part of the design both internally and externally, owing to
the relatively moderate scale of the 15 chapels which surround the
apsidal arms of the cross. In S.&nbsp;Petronio at Bologna, begun 1390 by
<i>Master Antonio</i>, the scale is better handled. The nave, 300 feet
long, is divided into six bays, each embracing two side chapels. It is
46 feet wide and 132 feet high, proportions which approximate those of
the French cathedrals, and produce an impression of size somewhat
unusual in Italian churches. <b>Orvieto</b> has internally little that
suggests Gothic architecture; like many Franciscan and Dominican
churches it is really a timber-roofed basilica with a few pointed
windows. The mixed Gothic and Romanesque interior of <b>Sienna
Cathedral</b> (Fig. 150), with its round arches and six-sided dome,
unsymmetrically placed over the crossing, is one of the most impressive
creations of Italian mediæval art. Alternate courses of black and white
marble add richness but not
<span class = "pagenum">260</span>
<a name = "page260" id = "page260"> </a>
repose to the effect of this interior: the same is true of Orvieto, and
of some other churches. The basement baptistery of
<b>S.&nbsp;Giovanni</b>, under the east end of Sienna Cathedral, is much
more purely Gothic in detail.</p>

<p>In these, and indeed in most Italian interiors, the main interest
centres less in the excellence of the composition than in the
accessories of pavements, pulpits, choir-stalls, and sepulchral
monuments. In these the decorative fancy and skill of the Italians found
unrestrained exercise, and produced works of surpassing interest and
merit.</p>


<p><b>EXTERNAL DESIGN.</b> The greatest possible disparity generally
exists between the sides and west fronts of the Italian churches. With
few exceptions the flanks present nothing like the variety of sky-line
and of light and shade customary in northern and western lands. The side
walls are high and flat, plain, or striped with black and white masonry
(Sienna, Orvieto), or veneered with marble (Duomo at Florence) or
decorated with surface-ornament of thin pilasters and arcades (Lucca).
The clearstory is low; the roof low&mdash;pitched and hardly visible
from below. Color, rather than structural richness, is generally sought
for: Milan Cathedral is almost the only exception, and goes to the other
extreme, with its seemingly countless buttresses, pinnacles and
statues.</p>

<p>The façades, on the other hand, were treated as independent
decorative compositions, and were in many cases remarkably beautiful
works, though having little or no organic relation to the main
structure. The most celebrated are those of <b>Sienna</b> (cathedral
begun 1243; façade 1284 by <i>Giovanni Pisano</i>; Fig. 151) and
<b>Orvieto</b> (begun 1290 by <i>Lorenzo Maitani</i>; façade 1310). Both
of these are sumptuous polychromatic compositions in marble, designed on
somewhat similar lines, with three high gables fronting the three
aisles, with deeply recessed portals, pinnacled turrets flanking nave
and aisles, and a central circular window. That
<span class = "pagenum">261</span>
<a name = "page261" id = "page261"> </a>
of Orvieto is furthermore embellished with mosaic pictures, and is the
more brilliant in color of the two. The mediæval façades of the
Florentine Gothic churches were never completed; but the elegance of the
panelling and of the tracery with twisted shafts in the flanks of the
cathedral, and the florid beauty of its side doorways (late 14th
century) would doubtless if realized with equal success on the façades,
have produced strikingly beautiful results. The modern façade of the
Duomo, by the late <i>De Fabris</i> (1887) is a correct if not highly
imaginative version of the style so applied. The front of Milan
cathedral (soon to be replaced by a new façade), shows a mixture of
Gothic and Renaissance forms. <b>Ferrara Cathedral</b>, although
internally transformed in the last century, retains its fine
13th-century three-gabled and arcaded screen front; one of the most
Gothic in spirit of all Italian façades. The <b>Cathedral</b> of
<b>Genoa</b> presents Gothic windows and deeply recessed portals in a
façade built in black and white bands, like Sienna cathedral and many
churches in Pistoia and Pisa.</p>

FIG. 151.&mdash;FAÇADE OF SIENNA CATHEDRAL.</p>

<p>Externally the most important feature was frequently a cupola or dome
over the crossing. That of Sienna has already been mentioned; that of
Milan is a sumptuous many-pinnacled structure terminating in a spire 300
feet high.
<span class = "pagenum">262</span>
<a name = "page262" id = "page262"> </a>
The <b>Certosa</b> at Pavia (Fig. 152) and the earlier Carthusian church
of Chiaravalle have internal cupolas or domes covered externally by
many-storied structures ending in a tower dominating the whole edifice.
These two churches, like many others in Lombardy, the Æmilia and
Venetia, are built of brick, moulded terra-cotta being effectively used
for the cornices, string-courses, jambs and ornaments of the exterior.
The Certosa at Pavia is contemporary with the cathedral of Milan, to
which it offers a surprising contrast, both in style and material. It is
wholly built of brick and terra-cotta, and, save for its ribbed
vaulting, possesses hardly a single Gothic feature or detail. Its
arches, mouldings, and cloisters suggest both the Romanesque and the
Renaissance styles by their semi-classic character.</p>

<p><b>PLANS.</b> The wide diversity of local styles in Italian
architecture appears in the plans as strikingly as in the details
<span class = "pagenum">263</span>
<a name = "page263" id = "page263"> </a>
In general one notes a love of spaciousness which expresses itself in a
sometimes disproportionate breadth, and in the wide spacing of the
piers. The polygonal chevet with its radial chapels is but rarely seen;
<b>S.&nbsp;Lorenzo</b> at Naples, Sta. Maria dei Servi and
S.&nbsp;Francesco at Bologna are among the most important examples. More
frequently the chapels form a range along the east side of the
transepts, especially in the Franciscan churches, which otherwise retain
many basilican features. A&nbsp;comparison of the plans of
S.&nbsp;Andrea at Vercelli, the Duomo at Florence, the cathedrals of
Sienna and Milan, S.&nbsp;Petronio at Bologna and the Certosa at Pavia
(Fig. 153), sufficiently illustrates the variety of Italian Gothic
plan-types.</p>


<p><b>ORNAMENT.</b> Applied decoration plays a large part in all Italian
Gothic designs. Inlaid and mosaic patterns and panelled veneering in
colored marble are essential features of the exterior decoration of most
Italian churches. Florence offers a fine example of this treatment in
the Duomo, and in its accompanying <b>Campanile</b> or bell-tower,
designed by <i>Giotto</i> (1335), and completed by <i>Gaddi</i> and
<i>Talenti</i>. This beautiful tower is an epitome of Italian Gothic
art. Its inlays, mosaics, and veneering are treated with consummate
elegance, and combined with incrusted reliefs of great beauty. The
tracery of this monument and of the side windows of the adjoining
cathedral is lighter and more graceful than is common in Italy. Its
beauty consists, however, less in movement of line than in richness and
elegance of carved and inlaid ornament. In
<span class = "pagenum">264</span>
<a name = "page264" id = "page264"> </a>
the <b>Or San Michele</b>&mdash;a&nbsp;combined chapel and granary in
Florence dating from 1330&mdash;the tracery is far less light and open.
In general, except in churches like the Cathedral of Milan, built under
German influences, the tracery in secular monuments is more successful
than in ecclesiastical structures. Venice developed the designing of
tracery to greater perfection in her palaces than any other Italian city
(see below).</p>

FIG. 154.&mdash;UPPER PART OF CAMPANILE, FLORENCE.</p>

<p><b>MINOR WORKS.</b> Italian Gothic art found freer expression in
semi-decorative works, like tombs, altars and votive chapels, than in
more monumental structures. The fourteenth century was particularly rich
in canopy tombs, mostly in churches, though some were erected in the
open air, like the celebrated <b>Tombs of the Scaligers</b> in Verona
(1329&ndash;1380). Many of those in churches in and near Rome, and
others in south Italy, are especially rich in inlay of <i>opus
Alexandrinum</i> upon their twisted columns and panelled sarcophagi. The
family of the <i>Cosmati</i> acquired great fame for work of this kind
during the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>The little marble chapel of <b>Sta. Maria della Spina</b>, on the
Arno, at Pisa, is an instance of the successful decorative use of Gothic
forms in minor buildings.</p>


<p><b>TOWERS.</b> The Italians always preferred the square tower to the
spire, and in most cases treated it as an independent campanile.
Following Early Christian and Romanesque traditions, these square towers
were usually built with plain sides unbroken by buttresses, and
terminated in a flat roof or a low and inconspicuous cone or pyramid.
The Campanile at Florence already mentioned is by far the most beautiful
of these designs (Fig. 154). The campaniles of Sienna, Lucca, and
Pistoia are built in alternate white and black courses, like the
adjoining cathedrals. Verona and Mantua have towers with octagonal
lanterns. In general, these Gothic towers differ from the earlier
Romanesque models only in the forms of their openings. Though dignified
in
<span class = "pagenum">265</span>
<a name = "page265" id = "page265"> </a>
their simplicity and size, and usually well proportioned, they lack the
beauty and interest of the French, English, and German steeples and
towers.</p>

FIG. 155.<!-- invisible . -->&mdash;UPPER PART OF<br>
PALAZZO VECCHIO, FLORENCE.</p>

<p><b>SECULAR MONUMENTS.</b> In their public halls, open <i>loggias</i>,
and domestic architecture the Italians were able to develop the
application of Gothic forms with greater freedom than in their
church-building, because unfettered by traditional methods of design.
The early and vigorous growth of municipal and popular institutions led,
as in the Netherlands, to the building of two classes of public
halls&mdash;the town hall proper or <i>Podestà</i>, and the council
hall, variously called <i>Palazzo Communale</i>, <i>Pubblico</i>, or
<i>del Consiglio</i>. The town halls, as the seat of authority, usually
have a severe and fortress-like character; the <b>Palazzo Vecchio</b> at
Florence is the most important example (1298, by Arnolfo di Cambio; Fig.
155). It is especially remarkable for its tower, which, rising 308 feet
in the air, overhangs the street nearly 6&nbsp;feet, its front wall
resting on the face of the powerfully corbelled cornice of the palace.
The court and most of the interior were remodelled in the sixteenth
century. At Sienna is a somewhat
<span class = "pagenum">266</span>
<a name = "page266" id = "page266"> </a>
similar structure in brick, the <b>Palazzo Pubblico</b>. At Pistoia the
Podestà and the Communal Palace stand opposite each other; in both of
these the courtyards still retain their original aspect. At Perugia,
Bologna, and Viterbo are others of some importance; while in Lombardy,
Bergamo, Como, Cremona, Piacenza and other towns possess smaller halls
with open arcades below, of a more elegant and pleasing aspect. More
successful still are the open loggias or tribunes erected for the
gatherings of public bodies. The <b>Loggia dei Lanzi</b> at Florence
(1376, by <i>Benci di Cione</i> and <i>Simone di Talenti</i>) is the
largest and most famous of these open vaulted halls, of which several
exist in Florence and Sienna. Gothic only in their minor details, they
are Romanesque or semi-classic in their broad round arches and strong
horizontal lines and cornices (Fig. 156).</p>

<p><b>PALACES AND HOUSES: VENICE.</b> The northern cities, especially
Pisa, Florence, Sienna, Bologna, and Venice, are rich in mediæval public
and private palaces and dwellings in brick or marble, in which pointed
windows and open arcades are used with excellent effect. In Bologna and
Sienna brick is used, in conjunction with details executed in moulded
terra-cotta, in a highly artistic and effective way. Viterbo, nearer
Rome, also possesses many interesting
<span class = "pagenum">267</span>
<a name = "page267" id = "page267"> </a>
houses with street arcades and open stairways or stoops leading to the
main entrance.</p>

<p class = "illustration">

<img src = "images/fig156.jpg" width = "403" height = "276"

FIG. 156.&mdash;LOGGIA DEI LANZI, FLORENCE.</p>

<p>The security and prosperity of Venice in the Middle Ages, and the
ever present influence of the sun-loving East, made the massive and
fortress-like architecture of the inland cities unnecessary. Abundant
openings, large windows full of tracery of great lightness and elegance,
projecting balconies and the freest use of marble veneering and
inlay&mdash;a&nbsp;survival of Byzantine traditions of the 12th century
(see <a href = "#page133">p.&nbsp;133</a>)&mdash;give to the Venetian
houses and palaces an air of gayety and elegance found nowhere else.
While there are few Gothic churches of importance in Venice, the number
of mediæval houses and palaces is very large. Chief among these is the
<b>Doge’s Palace</b> (Fig. 157), adjoining the church of St. Mark. The
two-storied arcades of the west and south fronts date from 1354, and
originally stood out from the main edifice, which was
<span class = "pagenum">268</span>
<a name = "page268" id = "page268"> </a>
widened in the next century, when the present somewhat heavy walls, laid
up in red, white and black marble in a species of quarry-pattern, were
built over the arcades. These arcades are beautiful designs, combining
massive strength and grace in a manner quite foreign to Western Gothic
ideas. Lighter and more ornate is the <b>Ca d’Oro</b>, on the Grand
Canal; while the Foscari, Contarini-Fasan, Cavalli, and Pisani palaces,
among many others, are admirable examples of the style. In most of these
a traceried loggia occupies the central part, flanked by walls incrusted
with marble and pierced by Gothic windows with carved mouldings,
borders, and balconies. The Venetian Gothic owes its success largely to
the absence of structural difficulties to interfere with the purely
decorative development of Gothic details.</p>
