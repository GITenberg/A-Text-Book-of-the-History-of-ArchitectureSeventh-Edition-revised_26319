PREFACE.</a></h3>


<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> aim of this work has been to
sketch the various periods and styles of architecture with the broadest
possible strokes, and to mention, with such brief characterization as
seemed permissible or necessary, the most important works of each period
or style. Extreme condensation in presenting the leading facts of
architectural history has been necessary, and much that would rightly
claim place in a larger work has been omitted here. The danger was felt
to be rather in the direction of too much detail than of too little.
While the book is intended primarily to meet the special requirements of
the college student, those of the general reader have not been lost
sight of. The majority of the technical terms used are defined or
explained in the context, and the small remainder in a glossary at the
end of the work. Extended criticism and minute description were out of
the question, and discussion of controverted points has been in
consequence as far as possible avoided.</p>

<p>The illustrations have been carefully prepared with a view to
elucidating the text, rather than for pictorial effect. With the
exception of some fifteen cuts reproduced from Lübke’s <i>Geschichte der
Architektur</i> (by kind permission of Messrs. Seemann, of Leipzig), the
illustrations are almost all entirely new. A&nbsp;large number are from
<span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
<a name = "pagevi" id = "pagevi"> </a>
original drawings made by myself, or under my direction, and the
remainder are, with a few exceptions, half-tone reproductions prepared
specially for this work from photographs in my possession.
Acknowledgments are due to Messrs. H.&nbsp;W. Buemming, H.&nbsp;D.
Bultman, and A.&nbsp;E. Weidinger for valued assistance in preparing
original drawings; and to Professor W.&nbsp;R. Ware, to Professor
W.&nbsp;H. Thomson, M.D., and to the Editor of the Series for much
helpful criticism and suggestion.</p>

<p>It is hoped that the lists of monuments appended to the history of
each period down to the present century may prove useful for reference,
both to the student and the general reader, as a supplement to the body
of the text.</p>

INTRODUCTION.</a></h3>


<p><span class = "firstword">A history</span> of architecture is a
record of man’s efforts to build beautifully. The erection of structures
devoid of beauty is mere building, a&nbsp;trade and not an art. Edifices
in which strength and stability alone are sought, and in designing which
only utilitarian considerations have been followed, are properly works
of engineering. Only when the idea of beauty is added to that of use
does a structure take its place among works of architecture. We may,
then, define architecture as the art which seeks to harmonize in a
building the requirements of utility and of beauty. It is the most
useful of the fine arts and the noblest of the useful arts. It touches
the life of man at every point. It is concerned not only in sheltering
his person and ministering to his comfort, but also in providing him
with places for worship, amusement, and business; with tombs, memorials,
embellishments for his cities, and other structures for the varied needs
of a complex civilization. It engages the services of a larger portion
of the community and involves greater outlays of money than any other
occupation except agriculture. Everyone at some point comes in contact
with the work of the architect, and from this universal contact
architecture derives its significance as an index of the civilization of
an age, a&nbsp;race, or a people.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xxii</span>
<a name = "pagexxii" id = "pagexxii"> </a>
<p>It is the function of the historian of architecture to trace the
origin, growth, and decline of the architectural styles which have
prevailed in different lands and ages, and to show how they have
reflected the great movements of civilization. The migrations, the
conquests, the commercial, social, and religious changes among different
peoples have all manifested themselves in the changes of their
architecture, and it is the historian’s function to show this. It is
also his function to explain the principles of the styles, their
characteristic forms and decoration, and to describe the great
masterpieces of each style and period.</p>

<p><b>STYLE</b> is a quality; the “historic styles” are phases of
development. <i>Style</i> is character expressive of definite
conceptions, as of grandeur, gaiety, or solemnity. An <i>historic
style</i> is the particular phase, the characteristic manner of design,
which prevails at a given time and place. It is not the result of mere
accident or caprice, but of intellectual, moral, social, religious, and
even political conditions. Gothic architecture could never have been
invented by the Greeks, nor could the Egyptian styles have grown up in
Italy. Each style is based upon some fundamental principle springing
from its surrounding civilization, which undergoes successive
developments until it either reaches perfection or its possibilities are
exhausted, after which a period of decline usually sets in. This is
followed either by a reaction and the introduction of some radically new
principle leading to the evolution of a new style, or by the final decay
and extinction of the civilization and its replacement by some younger
and more virile element. Thus the history of architecture appears as a
connected chain of causes and effects succeeding each other without
break, each style growing out of that which preceded it, or springing
out of the fecundating contact of a higher with a lower civilization. To
study architectural styles is therefore to study a branch of the history
of civilization.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xxiii</span>
<a name = "pagexxiii" id = "pagexxiii"> </a>
<p>Technically, architectural styles are identified by the means they
employ to cover enclosed spaces, by the characteristic forms of the
supports and other members (piers, <!-- invisible comma --> columns,
arches, mouldings, traceries, etc.), and by their decoration. The
<b>plan</b> should receive special attention, since it shows the
arrangement of the points of support, and hence the nature of the
structural design. A&nbsp;comparison, for example, of the plans of the
Hypostyle Hall at Karnak (<a href = "arch1.html#fig11">Fig.
11,&nbsp;<i>h</i></a>) and of the Basilica of Constantine (<a href =
"arch1.html#fig58">Fig.&nbsp;58</a>) shows at once a radical
difference in constructive principle between the two edifices, and hence
a difference of style.</p>

<p><b>STRUCTURAL PRINCIPLES.</b> All architecture is based on one or
more of three fundamental structural principles; that of the
<i>lintel</i>, of the <i>arch</i> or <i>vault</i>, and of the
<i>truss</i>. The principle of the <b>lintel</b> is that of resistance
to transverse strains, and appears in all construction in which a
cross-piece or beam rests on two or more vertical supports. The
<b>arch</b> or <b>vault</b> makes use of several pieces to span an
opening between two supports. These pieces are in compression and exert
lateral pressures or <i>thrusts</i> which are transmitted to the
supports or abutments. The thrust must be resisted either by the
massiveness of the abutments or by the opposition to it of
counter-thrusts from other arches or vaults. Roman builders used the
first, Gothic builders the second of these means of resistance. The
<b>truss</b> is a framework so composed of several pieces of wood or
metal that each shall best resist the particular strain, whether of
tension or compression, to which it is subjected, the whole forming a
compound beam or arch. It is especially applicable to very wide spans,
and is the most characteristic feature of modern construction. How the
adoption of one or another of these principles affected the forms and
even the decoration of the various styles, will be shown in the
succeeding chapters.</p>

<p><b>HISTORIC DEVELOPMENT.</b> Geographically and chronologically,
architecture appears to have originated in the Nile
<span class = "pagenum">xxiv</span>
<a name = "pagexxiv" id = "pagexxiv"> </a>
valley. A&nbsp;second centre of development is found in the valley of
the Tigris and Euphrates, not uninfluenced by the older Egyptian art.
Through various channels the Greeks inherited from both Egyptian and
Assyrian art, the two influences being discernible even through the
strongly original aspect of Greek architecture. The Romans in turn,
adopting the external details of Greek architecture, transformed its
substance by substituting the Etruscan arch for the Greek construction
of columns and lintels. They developed a complete and original system of
construction and decoration and spread it over the civilized world,
which has never wholly outgrown or abandoned&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>With the fall of Rome and the rise of Constantinople these forms
underwent in the East another transformation, called the Byzantine, in
the development of Christian domical church architecture. In the North
and West, meanwhile, under the growing institutions of the papacy and of
the monastic orders and the emergence of a feudal civilization out of
the chaos of the Dark Ages, the constant preoccupation of architecture
was to evolve from the basilica type of church a vaulted structure, and
to adorn it throughout with an appropriate dress of constructive and
symbolic ornament. Gothic architecture was the outcome of this
preoccupation, and it prevailed throughout northern and western Europe
until nearly or quite the close of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>During this fifteenth century the Renaissance style matured in Italy,
where it speedily triumphed over Gothic fashions and produced a
marvellous series of civic monuments, palaces, and churches, adorned
with forms borrowed or imitated from classic Roman art. This influence
spread through Europe in the sixteenth century, and ran a course of two
centuries, after which a period of servile classicism was followed by a
rapid decline in taste. To this succeeded the eclecticism and confusion
of the nineteenth century, to
<span class = "pagenum">xxv</span>
<a name = "pagexxv" id = "pagexxv"> </a>
which the rapid growth of new requirements and development of new
resources have largely contributed.</p>

<p>In Eastern lands three great schools of architecture have grown up
contemporaneously with the above phases of Western art; one under the
influence of Mohammedan civilization, another in the Brahman and
Buddhist architecture of India, and the third in China and Japan. The
first of these is the richest and most important. Primarily inspired
from Byzantine art, always stronger on the decorative than on the
constructive side, it has given to the world the mosques and palaces of
Northern Africa, Moorish Spain, Persia, Turkey, and India. The other two
schools seem to be wholly unrelated to the first, and have no affinity
with the architecture of Western lands.</p>

<p>Of Mexican, Central American, and South American architecture so
little is known, and that little is so remote in history and spirit from
the styles above enumerated, that it belongs rather to archæology than
to architectural history, and will not be considered in this work.</p>

pith, lucidity, and practical convenience; and that it is sound and
accurate the author’s name is a sufficient guarantee. Essential
historical and biographical facts, together with brief critical
estimates and characterizations of leading schools and painters, are
given in a few well-chosen words; and for students who wish to pursue
the subject in detail, a&nbsp;list of selected authorities at the head
of each chapter points the way. Serviceable lists are also provided of
principal extant works, together with the places where they are to be
found. The text is liberally sprinkled with illustrations in
half-tone.”&mdash;<span class = "smallcaps">Dial, Chicago</span>.</p>

<p>“Prof. Van Dyke has performed his task with great thoroughness and
good success.... He seems to us singularly happy in his characterization
of various artists, and amazingly just in proportion. We have hardly
found an instance in which the relative importance accorded a given
artist seemed to us manifestly wrong, and hardly one in which the
special characteristics of a style were not adequately presented.”<!--

<p>“... Gives a good general view of the subject, avoiding as a rule all
elaborate theories and disputed points, and aiming to distinguish the
various historical schools from one another by their differences of
subject and technique ... we do not know of anybody who has, on the

The book is modern in spirit and thoroughly up-to-date in point of
information.”&mdash;<span class = "smallcaps">Art Amateur</span>.</p>

<p>“Professor Van Dyke has made a radical departure in one respect, in
purposely omitting the biographical details with which text-books on art
are usually encumbered, and substituting short critical estimates of
artists and of their rank among the painters of their time. This feature
of the work is highly to be commended, as it affords means for
comparative study that cannot fail to be beneficial.... Altogether
Professor Van Dyke’s text-book is worthy of general adoption, and as a
volume of ready reference for the family library it will have a distinct
usefulness. It is compact, comprehensive, and admirably
arranged.”&mdash;<span class = "smallcaps">Beacon, Boston</span>.</p>

Errors and Inconsistencies</a></h4>

<p>Missing or invisible punctuation has been silently supplied, as have
missing umlauts and line-end hyphens. Errors of this type were assumed
to be mechanical, introduced either in printing or scanning.</p>

<p>Hyphenization of some words was inconsistent: zigzag and zig-zag,
semicircular and semi-circular, staircase and stair-case. The plural of
“portico” is regularly “porticos”, rarely “porticoes”. Both occurrences
of “mantelpiece” are at line-break; the hyphen was omitted based on
usage in the 8th edition.</p>

<p>Alphabetization in the Index is as printed.</p>

<h5>Names</h5>

<div class = "hanging">
<p>The architect Robert Adam is consistently called “Adams”; the error
was corrected in the 8th edition. The name form “Michael Angelo” is
standard for the time.</p>

<p>Columbia College changed its name to Columbia University in 1896,
presumably after the book’s original preface (dated January 20, 1896)
was
written.</p>

<p>The French palace is variously Luxembourg and Luxemburg.</p>
</div>

<h5>Place Names</h5>

<p>Spelling of place names was unchanged except when there was an
unambiguous error.</p>

<p>The form “Herculanum” (for Herculanum) was used consistently. The
English city is Peterboro’ (with apostrophe) in its first few
appearances, and then changes to Peterborough for the remainder of the
book. The Italian city was conventionally spelled “Sienna” (with
two n’s) in English.</p>

<p>Many names, especially non-European ones, differ significantly from
their modern form. Some of the following are conjectural.</p>

<table class = "names" summary = "place names">
<tr>
<td>Ipsamboul</td>
<td><p>Abu Simbel</p></td>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
