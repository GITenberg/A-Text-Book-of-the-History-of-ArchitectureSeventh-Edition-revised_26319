<p><b>THE CLASSIC REVIVAL.</b> The abandonment of Gothic architecture in
Italy and the substitution in its place of forms derived from classic
models were occasioned by no sudden or merely local revolution. The
Renaissance was the result of a profound and universal intellectual
movement, whose roots may be traced far back into the Middle Ages, and
which manifested itself first in Italy simply because there the
conditions were most propitious. It spread through Europe just as
rapidly as similar conditions appearing in other countries prepared the
way for it. The essence of this far-reaching movement was the protest of
the individual reason against the trammels of external and arbitrary
authority&mdash;a&nbsp;protest which found its earliest organized
expression in the Humanists. In its assertion of the intellectual and
moral rights of the individual, the Renaissance laid the foundations of
modern civilization. The same spirit, in rejecting the authority and
teachings of the
<span class = "pagenum">271</span>
<a name = "page271" id = "page271"> </a>
Church in matters of purely secular knowledge, led to the questionings
of the precursors of modern science and the discoveries of the early
navigators. But in nothing did the reaction against mediæval
scholasticism and asceticism display itself more strikingly than in the
joyful enthusiasm which marked the pursuit of classic studies. The
long-neglected treasures of classic literature were reopened, almost
rediscovered, in the fourteenth century by the immortal
trio&mdash;Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio. The joy of living, the
hitherto forbidden delight in beauty and pleasure for their own sakes,
the exultant awakening to the sense of personal freedom, which came with
the bursting of mediæval fetters, found in classic art and literature
their most sympathetic expression. It was in Italy, where feudalism had
never fully established itself, and where the municipalities and guilds
had developed, as nowhere else, the sense of civic and personal freedom,
that these symptoms first manifested themselves. In Italy, and above all
in the Tuscan cities, they appeared throughout the fourteenth century in
the growing enthusiasm for all that recalled the antique culture, and in
the rapid advance of luxury and refinement in both public and private
life.</p>


<p><b>THE RENAISSANCE OF THE ARTS.</b> Classic Roman architecture had
never lost its influence on the Italian taste. Gothic art, already
declining in the West, had never been in Italy more than a borrowed
garb, clothing architectural conceptions classic rather than Gothic in
spirit. The antique monuments which abounded on every hand were ever
present models for the artist, and to the Florentines of the early
fifteenth century the civilization which had created them represented
the highest ideal of human culture. They longed to revive in their own
time the glories of ancient Rome, and appropriated with uncritical and
undiscriminating enthusiasm the good and the bad, the early and the late
forms of Roman art, Naïvely unconscious of the disparity
<span class = "pagenum">272</span>

between their own architectural conceptions and those they fancied they
imitated, they were, unknown to themselves, creating a new style, in
which the details of Roman art were fitted in novel combinations to new
requirements. In proportion as the Church lost its hold on the culture
of the age, this new architecture entered increasingly into the service
of private luxury and public display. It created, it is true, striking
types of church design, and made of the dome one of the most imposing of
external features; but its most characteristic products were palaces,
villas, council halls, and monuments to the great and the powerful. The
personal element in design asserted itself as never before in the growth
of schools and the development of styles. Thenceforward the history of
Italian architecture becomes the history of the achievements of
individual artists.</p>


<p><b>EARLY BEGINNINGS.</b> Already in the 13th century the pulpits of
Niccolo Pisano at Sienna and Pisa had revealed that master’s direct
recourse to antique monuments for inspiration and suggestion. In the
frescoes of Giotto and his followers, and in the architectural details
of many nominally Gothic buildings, classic forms had appeared with
increasing frequency during the fourteenth century. This was especially
true in Florence, which was then the artistic capital of Italy. Never,
perhaps, since the days of Pericles, had there been another community so
permeated with the love of beauty in art, and so endowed with the
capacity to realize it. Nowhere else in Europe at that time was there
such strenuous life, such intense feeling, or such free course for
individual genius as in Florence. Her artists, with unexampled
versatility, addressed themselves with equal success to goldsmiths’
work, sculpture, architecture and engineering&mdash;often to painting
and poetry as well; and they were quick to catch in their art the spirit
of the classic revival. The new movement achieved its first
architectural
<span class = "pagenum">273</span>
<a name = "page273" id = "page273"> </a>
triumph in the dome of the cathedral of Florence (1420&ndash;64); and it
was Florentine&mdash;or at least Tuscan&mdash;artists who planted in
other centres the seeds of the new art that were to spring up in the
local and provincial schools of Sienna, Milan, Pavia, Bologna, and
Venice, of Brescia, Lucca, Perugia, and Rimini, and many other North
Italian cities. The movement asserted itself late in Rome and Naples, as
an importation from Northern Italy, but it bore abundant fruit in these
cities in its later stages.</p>


<p><b>PERIODS.</b> The classic styles which grew up out of the
Renaissance may be divided for convenience into four periods.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Early Renaissance</span> or <span class
= "smallcaps">Formative Period</span>, 1420&ndash;90; characterized by
the grace and freedom of the decorative detail, suggested by Roman
prototypes and applied to compositions of great variety and
originality.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The High Renaissance</span> or <span class
= "smallcaps">Formally Classic Period</span>, 1490&ndash;1550. During
this period classic details were copied with increasing fidelity, the
orders especially appearing in almost all compositions; decoration
meanwhile losing somewhat in grace and freedom.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Early Baroque</span> (or <span class =
"smallcaps">Baroco</span>), 1550&ndash;1600; a&nbsp;period of classic
formality characterized by the use of colossal orders, engaged columns
and rather scanty decoration.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Decline</span> or <span class =
"smallcaps">Later Baroque</span>, marked by poverty of invention in the
composition and a predominance of vulgar sham and display in the
decoration. Broken pediments, huge scrolls, florid stucco-work and a
general disregard of architectural propriety were universal.</p>

<p>During the eighteenth century there was a reaction from these
extravagances, which showed itself in a return to the servile copying of
classic models, sometimes not without a certain dignity of composition
and restraint in the decoration.</p>

<p>By many writers the name Renaissance is confined to the
<span class = "pagenum">274</span>
<a name = "page274" id = "page274"> </a>
first period. This is correct from the etymological point of view; but
it is impossible to dissociate the first period historically from those
which followed it, down to the final exhaustion of the artistic movement
to which it gave birth, in the heavy extravagances of the Rococo.</p>

<p>Another division is made by the Italians, who give the name of the
<i>Quattrocento</i> to the period which closed with the end of the
fifteenth century, <i>Cinquecento</i> to the sixteenth <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘cenury’">century</ins>, and
<i>Seicento</i> to the seventeenth century or Rococo. It has, however,
become common to confine the use of the term Cinquecento to the first
half of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p><b>CONSTRUCTION AND DETAIL.</b> The architects of the Renaissance
occupied themselves more with form than with construction, and rarely
set themselves constructive problems of great difficulty. Although the
new architecture began with the colossal dome of the cathedral of
Florence, and culminated in the stupendous church of St. Peter at Rome,
it was pre-eminently an architecture of palaces and villas, of façades
and of decorative display. Constructive difficulties were reduced to
their lowest terms, and the constructive framework was concealed, not
emphasized, by the decorative apparel of the design. Among the
masterpieces of the early Renaissance are many buildings of small
dimensions, such as gates, chapels, tombs and fountains. In these the
individual fancy had full sway, and produced surprising results by the
beauty of enriched mouldings, of carved friezes with infant genii,
wreaths of fruit, griffins, masks and scrolls; by pilasters covered with
arabesques as delicate in modelling as if wrought in silver; by inlays
of marble, panels of glazed terra-cotta, marvellously carved doors, fine
stucco-work in relief, capitals and cornices of wonderful richness and
variety. The Roman orders appeared only in free imitations, with
panelled and carved pilasters for the most part instead of columns, and
capitals
<span class = "pagenum">275</span>
<a name = "page275" id = "page275"> </a>
of fanciful design, recalling remotely the Corinthian by their volutes
and leaves (Fig. 158). Instead of the low-pitched classic pediments,
there appears frequently an arched cornice enclosing a sculptured
lunette. Doors and windows were enclosed in richly carved frames,
sometimes arched and sometimes square. Façades were flat and unbroken,
depending mainly for effect upon the distribution and adornment of the
openings, and the design of doorways, courtyards and cornices.
Internally vaults and flat ceilings of wood and plaster were about
equally common, the barrel vault and dome occurring far more frequently
than the groined vault. Many of the ceilings of this period are of
remarkable richness and beauty.</p>

FIG. 159.<!-- invisible . -->&mdash;SECTION OF DOME OF DUOMO,
FLORENCE.</p>

<p><b>THE EARLY RENAISSANCE IN FLORENCE: THE DUOMO.</b> In the year 1417
a public competition was held for completing the cathedral of Florence
by a dome over the immense octagon, 143 feet in diameter. <i>Filippo
Brunelleschi</i>, sculptor and architect (1377&ndash;1446), who with
Donatello had journeyed to Rome to study there the masterworks of
ancient art, after demonstrating the inadequacy of all the solutions
proposed by the competitors, was finally permitted to undertake the
gigantic task according to his own plans. These provided for an
octagonal dome in two shells, connected
<span class = "pagenum">276</span>
<a name = "page276" id = "page276"> </a>
by eight major and sixteen minor ribs, and crowned by a lantern at the
top (Fig. 159). This wholly original conception, by which for the first
time (outside of Moslem art) the dome was made an external feature fitly
terminating in the light forms and upward movement of a lantern, was
carried out between the years 1420 and 1464. Though in no wise an
imitation of Roman forms, it was classic in its spirit, in its vastness
and its simplicity of line, and was made possible solely by
Brunelleschi’s studies of Roman design and construction (Fig. 160).</p>


<p><b>OTHER CHURCHES.</b> From Brunelleschi’s designs were also erected
the <b>Pazzi Chapel</b> in Sta. Croce, a&nbsp;charming design of a Greek
cross covered with a dome at the intersection, and preceded by a
vestibule with a richly decorated vault; and the two great churches of
<b>S.&nbsp;Lorenzo</b> (1425) and <b>S.&nbsp;Spirito</b>
(1433&ndash;1476, Fig. 161). Both reproduced in a measure the plan of
the Pisa Cathedral, having a three-aisled nave and transepts, with a low
dome over the crossing. The side aisles were covered with domical vaults
and the central aisles with flat wooden or plaster ceilings. All the
details of columns, arches and mouldings were imitated from Roman
models, and yet the result was something entirely new. Consciously or
unconsciously, Brunelleschi was reviving Byzantine rather than Roman
conceptions in the planning and structural design of these domical
churches, but the garb in which he clothed them was Roman, at least in
detail. The <b>Old Sacristy</b> of S.&nbsp;Lorenzo was another domical
design of great beauty.</p>

FLORENCE.</p>

<p>From this time on the new style was in general use for church
designs. <i>L.&nbsp;B. Alberti</i> (1404&ndash;73), who had in Rome
mastered classic details more thoroughly than Brunelleschi, remodelled
the church of <b>S.&nbsp;Francesco</b> at <b>Rimini</b> with Roman
pilasters and arches, and with engaged orders in the façade, which,
however, was never completed. His great work was the church of
<b>S.&nbsp;Andrea</b> at <b>Mantua</b>, a&nbsp;Latin cross in plan, with
a dome at the intersection (the present high dome dating however, only
from the 18th century) and a façade to which the conception of a Roman
triumphal arch was skilfully adapted. His façade of incrusted marbles
for the church of S.&nbsp;M. Novella at Florence was a less successful
work, though its flaring consoles over the side aisles established an
unfortunate precedent frequently imitated in later churches.</p>

<p>A great activity in church-building marked the period between 1475
and 1490. The plans of the churches erected about this time throughout
north Italy display an interesting variety of arrangements, in nearly
all of which the dome is combined with the three-aisled cruciform plan,
either as a central feature at the crossing or as a domical vault over
each bay. Bologna and Ferrara possess a number of churches of this kind.
Occasionally the basilican arrangement was followed, with columnar
arcades separating
<span class = "pagenum">278</span>
<a name = "page278" id = "page278"> </a>
the aisles. More often, however, the pier-arches were of the Roman type,
with engaged columns or pilasters between them. The interiors,
presumably intended to receive painted decorations, were in most cases
somewhat bare of ornament, pleasing rather by happy proportions and
effective vaulting or rich flat ceilings, panelled, painted and gilded,
than by elaborate architectural detail. A&nbsp;similar scantiness of
ornament is to be remarked in the exteriors, excepting the façades,
which were sometimes highly ornate; the doorways, with columns,
pediments, sculpture and carving, receiving especial attention. High
external domes did not come into general use until the next period. In
Milan, Pavia, and some other Lombard cities, the internal cupola over
the crossing was, however, covered externally by a lofty structure in
diminishing stages, like that of the Certosa at Pavia (Fig. 152), or
that erected by Bramante for the church of S.&nbsp;M. delle Grazie at
Milan. At Prato, in the church of the <b>Madonna delle Carceri</b>
(1495&ndash;1516), by <i>Giuliano da S.&nbsp;Gallo</i>, the type of the
Pazzi chapel reappears in a larger scale; the plan is cruciform, with
equal or nearly equal arms covered by barrel vaults, at whose
intersection rises a dome of
<span class = "pagenum">279</span>
<a name = "page279" id = "page279"> </a>
moderate height on pendentives. This charming edifice, with its
unfinished exterior of white marble, its simple and dignified lines, and
internal embellishments in della-Robbia ware, is one of the masterpieces
of the period.</p>

<p>In the designing of chapels and oratories the architects of the early
Renaissance attained conspicuous success, these edifices presenting
fewer structural limitations and being more purely decorative in
character than the larger churches. Such façades as that of
<b>S.&nbsp;Bernardino</b> at Perugia and of the <b>Frati di
S.&nbsp;Spirito</b> at Bologna are among the most delightful products of
the decorative fancy of the 15th century.</p>

FIG. 162.&mdash;COURTYARD OF RICCARDI PALACE, FLORENCE.<!-- invisible
all . --></p>

<p><b>FLORENTINE PALACES.</b> While the architects of this period failed
to develop any new and thoroughly satisfactory ecclesiastical type, they
attained conspicuous success in palace-architecture. The <b>Riccardi</b>
palace in Florence (1430) marks the first step of the Renaissance in
this direction. It was built for the great Cosimo di Medici by
<i>Michelozzi</i> (1397&ndash;1473), a&nbsp;contemporary of Brunelleschi
and Alberti, and a man of great talent. Its imposing rectangular façade,
with widely spaced mullioned windows in two stories over a massive
basement, is crowned with a classic cornice of unusual and perhaps
excessive size. In
<span class = "pagenum">280</span>
<a name = "page280" id = "page280"> </a>
spite of the bold and fortress-like character of the rusticated masonry
of these façades, and the mediæval look they seem to present to modern
eyes, they marked a revolution in style and established a type
frequently imitated in later years. The courtyard, in contrast with this
stern exterior, appears light and cheerful (Fig. 162). Its wall is
carried on round arches borne by columns with Corinthianesque capitals,
and the arcade is enriched with sculptured medallions. <b>The Pitti
Palace</b>, by Brunelleschi (1435), embodies the same ideas on a more
colossal scale, but lacks the grace of an adequate cornice.
A&nbsp;lighter and more ornate style appeared in 1460 in the
<b>P.&nbsp;Rucellai</b>, by Alberti, in which for the first time
classical pilasters in superposed stages were applied to a street
façade. To avoid the dilemma of either insufficiently crowning the
edifice or making the cornice too heavy for the upper range of
pilasters, Alberti made use of brackets, occupying the width of the
upper frieze, and converting the whole upper entablature into a cornice.
But this compromise was not quite successful, and it remained for later
architects in Venice, Verona, and Rome to work out more satisfactory
methods of applying the orders to many-storied palace façades. In the
great <b>P.&nbsp;Strozzi</b> (Fig. 163), erected in 1490 by <i>Benedetto
da Majano</i> and <i>Cronaca</i>, the architects reverted to the earlier
type of the P.&nbsp;Riccardi, treating it with greater refinement and
producing one of the noblest palaces of Italy.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">281</span>
<a name = "page281" id = "page281"> </a>
<p><b>COURTYARDS; ARCADES.</b> These palaces were all built around
interior courts, whose walls rested on columnar arcades, as in the
P.&nbsp;Riccardi (Fig. 162). The origin of these arcades may be found in
the arcaded cloisters of mediæval monastic churches, which often suggest
classic models, as in those of St. Paul-beyond-the-Walls and St. John
Lateran at Rome. Brunelleschi not only introduced columnar arcades into
a number of cloisters and palace courts, but also used them effectively
as exterior features in the <b>Loggia S.&nbsp;Paolo</b> and the
Foundling Hospital (<b>Ospedale degli Innocenti</b>) at Florence. The
chief drawback in these light arcades was their inability to withstand
the thrust of the vaulting over the space behind them, and the
consequent recourse to iron tie-rods where vaulting was used. The
Italians, however, seemed to care little about this disfigurement.</p>


<p><b>MINOR WORKS.</b> The details of the new style were developed quite
as rapidly in purely decorative works as in monumental buildings.
Altars, mural monuments, tabernacles, pulpits and <i>ciboria</i>
afforded scope for the genius of the most distinguished artists. Among
those who were specially celebrated in works of this kind should be
named <i>Lucca della Robbia</i> (1400&ndash;82) and his successors,
<i>Mino da Fiesole</i> (1431&ndash;84) and <i>Benedetto da Majano</i>
(1442&ndash;97). Possessed of a wonderful fertility of invention, they
and their pupils multiplied their works in extraordinary number and
variety, not only throughout north Italy, but also in Rome and Naples.
Among the most famous examples of this branch of design may be mentioned
a pulpit in Sta. Croce by B.&nbsp;da Majano; a&nbsp;terra-cotta fountain
in the sacristy of S.&nbsp;M. Novella, by the della Robbias; the
Marsupini tomb in Sta. Croce, by <i>Desiderio da Settignano</i> (all in
Florence); the della Rovere tomb in S.&nbsp;M. del Popolo, Rome, by Mino
da Fiesole, and in the Cathedral at Lucca the Noceto tomb and the
Tempietto, by <i>Matteo Civitali</i>. It was in
<span class = "pagenum">282</span>
<a name = "page282" id = "page282"> </a>
works of this character that the Renaissance oftenest made its first
appearance in a new centre, as was the case in Sienna, Pisa, Lucca,
Naples, etc.</p>

FIG. 164.&mdash;TOMB OF PIETRO DI NOCETO, LUCCA.</p>


<p><b>NORTH ITALY.</b> Between 1450 and 1490 the Renaissance presented
in Sienna, in a number of important palaces, a&nbsp;sharp contrast to
the prevalent Gothic style of that city. The
<b>P.&nbsp;Piccolomini</b>&mdash;a&nbsp;somewhat crude imitation of the
P.&nbsp;Riccardi in Florence&mdash;dates from 1463; the <b>P.&nbsp;del
Governo</b> was built 1469, and the <b>Spannocchi Palace</b> in 1470. In
1463 <i>Ant. Federighi</i> built there the <b>Loggia del Papa</b>. About
the same time <i>Bernardo di Lorenzo</i> was building for Pope Pius II.
(Æneas Sylvius Piccolomini) an entirely new city, <b>Pienza</b>, with a
cathedral, archbishop’s palace, town hall and Papal residence (the
<b>P.&nbsp;Piccolomini</b>), which are interesting if not strikingly
original works. Pisa possesses few early Renaissance structures, owing
to the utter prostration of her fortunes
<span class = "pagenum">283</span>
<a name = "page283" id = "page283"> </a>
in the 15th century, and the dominance of Pisan Gothic traditions. In
Lucca, besides a wealth of minor monuments (largely the work of Matteo
Civitali, 1435&ndash;1501) in various churches, a&nbsp;number of palaces
date from this period, the most important being the
<b>P.&nbsp;Pretorio</b> and P.&nbsp;Bernardini. To Milan the Renaissance
was carried by the Florentine masters <i>Michelozzi</i> and
<i>Filarete</i>, to whom are respectively due the <b>Portinari
Chapel</b> in S.&nbsp;Eustorgio (1462) and the earlier part of the great
<b>Ospedale Maggiore</b> (1457). In the latter, an edifice of brick with
terra-cotta enrichments, the windows were Gothic in outline&mdash;an
unusual mixture of styles, even in Italy. The munificence of the
Sforzas, the hereditary tyrants of the province, embellished the
semi-Gothic <b>Certosa</b> of Pavia with a new marble façade, begun 1476
or 1491, which in its fanciful and exuberant decoration, and the small
scale of its parts, belongs properly to the early Renaissance.
Exquisitely beautiful in detail, it resembles rather a magnified
altar-piece than a work of architecture, properly speaking. Bologna and
Ferrara developed somewhat late in the century a strong local school of
architecture, remarkable especially for the beauty of its courtyards,
its graceful street arcades, and its artistic treatment of brick and
terra-cotta (<b>P.&nbsp;Bevilacqua</b>, <b>P.&nbsp;Fava</b>, at Bologna;
<b>P.&nbsp;Scrofa</b>, <b>P.&nbsp;Roverella</b>, at Ferrara). About the
same time palaces with interior arcades and details in the new style
were erected in Verona, Vicenza, Mantua, and other cities.</p>


<p><b>VENICE.</b> In this city of merchant princes and a wealthy
<i>bourgeoisie</i>, the architecture of the Renaissance took on a new
aspect of splendor and display. It was late in appearing, the Gothic
style with its tinge of Byzantine decorative traditions having here
developed into a style well suited to the needs of a rich and relatively
tranquil community. These traditions the architects of the new style
appropriated in a measure, as in the marble incrustations of the
exquisite little church of <b>S.&nbsp;M. dei Miracoli</b>
(1480&ndash;89), and the façade
<span class = "pagenum">284</span>
<a name = "page284" id = "page284"> </a>
of the <b>Scuola di S.&nbsp;Marco</b> (1485&ndash;1533), both by
<i>Pietro Lombardo</i>. Nowhere else, unless on the contemporary façade
of the Certosa at Pavia, were marble inlays and delicate carving,
combined with a framework of thin pilasters, finely profiled
entablatures and arched pediments, so lavishly bestowed upon the street
fronts of churches and palaces. The family of the <i>Lombardi</i>
(Martino, his sons Moro and Pietro, and grandsons Antonio and Tullio),
with <i>Ant. Bregno</i> and <i>Bart. Buon</i>, were the leaders in the
architectural Renaissance of this period, and to them Venice owes her
choicest masterpieces in the new style. Its first appearance is noted in
the later portions of the church of <b>S.&nbsp;Zaccaria</b>
(1456&ndash;1515), partly Gothic internally, with a façade whose
semicircular pediment and small decorative arcades show a somewhat timid
but interesting application of classic details. In this church, and
still more so in S.&nbsp;Giobbe (1451&ndash;93) and the Miracoli above
mentioned, the decorative element predominates throughout. It is hard to
imagine details more graceful in design, more effective in the swing of
their movement, or more delicate in execution than the mouldings,
reliefs, wreaths, scrolls, and capitals one encounters in these
buildings. Yet in structural interest, in scale and breadth of planning,
these early Renaissance Venetian buildings hold a relatively inferior
rank.</p>

FIG. 165.&mdash;VENDRAMINI PALACE, VENICE.</p>


<p><b>PALACES.</b> The great <b>Court</b> of the <b>Doge’s Palace</b>,
begun 1483 by <i>Ant. Rizzio</i>, belongs only in part to the first
period. It shows, however, the lack of constructive principle and of
largeness of composition just mentioned, but its decorative effect and
picturesque variety elicit almost universal admiration. Like the
neighboring façade of St. Mark’s, it violates nearly every principle of
correct composition, and yet in a measure atones for this capital defect
by its charm of detail. Far more satisfactory from the purely
architectural point of view is the façade of the
<b>P.&nbsp;Vendramini</b> (Vendramin-Calergi), by Pietro Lombardo
(1481). The simple,
<span class = "pagenum">285</span>
<a name = "page285" id = "page285"> </a>
stately lines of its composition, the dignity of its broad arched and
mullioned windows, separated by engaged columns&mdash;the earliest
example in Venice of this feature, and one of the earliest in
Italy&mdash;its well-proportioned basement and upper stories, crowned by
an adequate but somewhat heavy entablature, make this one of the finest
palaces in Italy (Fig. 165) It established a type of large-windowed,
vigorously modelled façades which later architects developed, but hardly
surpassed. In the smaller contemporary, P.&nbsp;Dario, another type
appears, better suited for small buildings, depending for effect mainly
upon well-ordered openings and incrusted panelling of colored
marble.</p>


<p><b>ROME.</b> Internal disorders and the long exile of the popes had
by the end of the fourteenth century reduced Rome to utter
insignificance. Not until the second half of the fifteenth century did
returning prosperity and wealth afford
<span class = "pagenum">286</span>
<a name = "page286" id = "page286"> </a>
the Renaissance its opportunity in the Eternal City. Pope
Nicholas&nbsp;V. had, indeed, begun the rebuilding of St. Peter’s from
designs by B.&nbsp;Rossellini, in 1450, but the project lapsed shortly
after with the death of the pope. The earliest Renaissance building in
Rome was the <b>P.&nbsp;di Venezia</b>, begun in 1455, together with the
adjoining porch of S.&nbsp;Marco. In this palace and the adjoining
unfinished Palazzetto we find the influence of the old Roman monuments
clearly manifested in the court arcades, built like those of the
Colosseum, with superposed stages of massive piers and engaged columns
carrying entablatures. The proportions are awkward, the details coarse;
but the spirit of Roman classicism is here seen in the germ. The
exterior of this palace is, however, still Gothic in spirit. The
architects are unknown; <i>Giuliano da Majano</i> (1452&ndash;90),
<i>Giacomo di Pietrasanta</i>, and <i>Meo del Caprino</i>
(1430&ndash;1501) are known to have worked upon it, but it is not
certain in what capacity.</p>

<p>The new style, reaching, and in time overcoming, the conservatism of
the Church, overthrew the old basilican traditions. In
<b>S.&nbsp;Agostino</b> (1479&ndash;83), by <i>Pietrasanta</i>, and
<b>S.&nbsp;M. del Popolo</b>, by Pintelli (?), piers with pilasters or
half-columns and massive arches separate the aisles, and the crossing is
crowned with a dome. To the same period belong the Sistine chapel and
parts of the Vatican palace, but the interest of these lies rather in
their later decorations than in their somewhat scanty architectural
merit.</p>

<p>The architectural renewal of Rome, thus begun, reached its
culmination in the following period.</p>


<p><b>OTHER MONUMENTS.</b> The complete enumeration of even the most
important Early Renaissance monuments of Italy is impossible within our
limits. Two or three only can here be singled out as suggesting types.
Among town halls of this period the first place belongs to the
<b>P.&nbsp;del Consiglio</b> at Verona, by <i>Fra Giocondo</i>
(1435&ndash;1515). In this beautiful edifice the façade consists of a
light and graceful
<span class = "pagenum">287</span>
<a name = "page287" id = "page287"> </a>
arcade supporting a wall pierced with four windows, and covered with
elaborate frescoed arabesques (recently restored). Its unfortunate
division by pilasters into four bays, with a pier in the centre, is a
blemish avoided in the contemporary <b>P.&nbsp;del Consiglio</b> at
Padua. The <b>Ducal Palace</b> at Urbino, by <i>Luciano da Laurano</i>
(1468), is noteworthy for its fine arcaded court, and was highly famed
in its day. At Brescia <b>S.&nbsp;M. dei Miracoli</b> is a remarkable
example of a cruciform domical church dating from the close of this
period, and is especially celebrated for the exuberant decoration of its
porch and its elaborate detail. Few campaniles were built in this
period; the best of them are at Venice. Naples possesses several
interesting Early Renaissance monuments, chief among which are the
<b>Porta Capuana</b> (1484), by <i>Giul. da Majano</i>, the triumphal
<b>Arch of Alphonso</b> of Arragon, by <i>Pietro di Martino</i>, and the
<b>P.&nbsp;Gravina</b>, by <i>Gab. d’Agnolo</i>. Naples is also very
rich in minor works of the early Renaissance, in which it ranks with
Florence, Venice, and Rome.</p>

<p><b>CHARACTER OF THE ADVANCED RENAISSANCE.</b> It was inevitable that
the study and imitation of Roman architecture should lead to an
increasingly literal rendering of classic details and a closer copying
of antique compositions. Toward the close of the fifteenth century the
symptoms began to multiply of the approaching reign of formal
classicism. Correctness in the reproduction of old Roman forms came in
time to be esteemed as one of the chief of architectural virtues, and in
the following period the orders became the principal resource of the
architect. During the so-called Cinquecento, that is, from the close of
the fifteenth century to nearly or quite 1550, architecture still
retained much of the freedom and refinement of the Quattrocento. There
was meanwhile a notable advance in dignity and amplitude of design,
especially in the internal distribution of buildings. Externally the
orders were freely used as subordinate features in the decoration of
doors and windows, and in court arcades of the Roman type. The
lantern-crowned
<span class = "pagenum">289</span>
<a name = "page289" id = "page289"> </a>
dome upon a high drum was developed into one of the noblest of
architectural forms. Great attention was bestowed upon all subordinate
features; doors and windows were treated with frames and pediments of
extreme elegance and refinement; all the cornices and mouldings were
proportioned and profiled with the utmost care, and the balustrade was
elaborated into a feature at once useful and highly ornate. Interior
decoration was even more splendid than before, if somewhat less delicate
and subtle; relief enrichments in stucco were used with admirable
effect, and the greatest artists exercised their talents in the painting
of vaults and ceilings, as in P.&nbsp;del Té at Mantua, by <i>Giulio
Romano</i> (1492&ndash;1546), and the Sistine Chapel at Rome, by Michael
Angelo. This period is distinguished by an exceptional number of great
architects and buildings. It was ushered in by <i>Bramante Lazzari</i>,
of Urbino (1444&ndash;1514), and closed during the career of <i>Michael
Angelo Buonarotti</i> (1475&ndash;1564); two names worthy to rank with
that of Brunelleschi. Inferior only to these in architectural genius
were <i>Raphael</i> (1483&ndash;1520), <i>Baldassare Peruzzi</i>
(1481&ndash;1536), <i>Antonio da San Gallo the Younger</i>
(1485&ndash;1546), and <i>G.&nbsp;Barozzi da Vignola</i>
(1507&ndash;1572), in Rome; <i>Giacopo Tatti Sansovino</i>
(1479&ndash;1570), in Venice, and others almost equally illustrious.
This period witnessed the erection of an extraordinary series of
palaces, villas, and churches, the beginning and much of the
construction of St. Peter’s at Rome, and a complete transformation in
the aspect of that city.</p>

FIG. 166.&mdash;FAÇADE OF THE GIRAUD PALACE, ROME.</p>

<p><b>BRAMANTE’S WORKS.</b> While precise time limits cannot be set to
architectural styles, it is not irrational to date this period from the
maturing of Bramante’s genius. While his earlier works in Milan belong
to the Quattrocento (S.&nbsp;M. delle Grazie, the sacristy of San
Satiro, the extension of the Great Hospital), his later designs show the
classic tendency very clearly. The charming <b>Tempietto</b> in the
court of
<span class = "pagenum">290</span>
<a name = "page290" id = "page290"> </a>
S.&nbsp;Pietro in Montorio at Rome, a&nbsp;circular temple-like chapel
(1502), is composed of purely classic elements. In the
<b>P.&nbsp;Giraud</b> (Fig. 166) and the great <b>Cancelleria</b>
Palace, pilasters appear in the external composition, and all the
details of doors and windows betray the results of classic study, as
well as the refined taste of their designer.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag24" id = "tag24" href = "#note24">24</a> The beautiful courtyard of
the Cancelleria combines the Florentine system of arches on columns with
the Roman system of superposed arcades independent of the court wall. In
1506 Bramante began the rebuilding of St. Peter’s for Julius II. (see <a
href = "#page294">p.&nbsp;294</a>) and the construction of a new and
imposing papal palace adjoining it on the Vatican hill. Of this colossal
group of edifices, commonly known as the <b>Vatican</b>, he executed the
greater Belvedere court (afterward divided in two by the Library and the
Braccio Nuovo), the lesser octagonal court of the Belvedere, and the
court of San Damaso, with its arcades afterward frescoed by Raphael and
his school. Besides these, the cloister of S.&nbsp;M. della Pace, and
many other works in and out of Rome, reveal the impress of Bramante’s
genius, alike in their admirable plans and in the harmony and beauty of
their details.</p>


<p><b>FLORENTINE PALACES.</b> The P. Riccardi long remained the accepted
type of palace in Florence. As we have seen, it was imitated in the
Strozzi palace, as late as 1489, with
<span class = "pagenum">291</span>
<a name = "page291" id = "page291"> </a>
greater perfection of detail, but with no radical change of conception.
In the <b>P.&nbsp;Gondi</b>, however, begun in the following year by
<i>Giuliano da San Gallo</i> (1445&ndash;1516), a&nbsp;more pronounced
classic spirit appears, especially in the court and the interior design.
Early in the 16th century classic columns and pediments began to be used
as decorations for doors and windows; the rustication was confined to
basements and corner-quoins, and niches, loggias, and porches gave
variety of light and shade to the façades (<b>P.&nbsp;Bartolini</b>, by
<i>Baccio d’Agnolo</i>; <b>P.&nbsp;Larderel</b>, 1515, by <i>Dosio</i>;
<b>P.&nbsp;Guadagni</b>, by <i>Cronaca</i>; <b>P.&nbsp;Pandolfini</b>,
1518, attributed to Raphael). In the <b>P.&nbsp;Serristori</b>, by
Baccio d’Agnolo (1510), pilasters were applied to the composition of the
façade, but this example was not often followed in Florence.</p>


<p><b>ROMAN PALACES.</b> These followed a different type. They were
usually of great size, and built around ample courts with arcades of
classic model in two or three stories. The broad street façade in three
stories with an attic or mezzanine was crowned with a rich cornice. The
orders were sparingly used externally, and effect was sought principally
in the careful proportioning of the stories, in the form and
distribution of the square-headed and arched openings, and in the design
of mouldings, string-courses, cornices, and other details. The <i>piano
nobile</i>, or first story above the basement, was given up to suites of
sumptuous reception-rooms and halls, with magnificent ceilings and
frescoes by the great painters of the day, while antique statues and
reliefs adorned the courts, vestibules, and niches of these princely
dwellings. The <b>Massimi</b> palace, by Peruzzi, is an interesting
example of this type. The Vatican, Cancelleria, and Giraud palaces have
already been mentioned; other notable palaces are the Palma (1506) and
Sacchetti (1540), by A.&nbsp;da San Gallo the Younger; the
<b>Farnesina</b>, by Peruzzi, with celebrated fresco decorations
designed by Raphael;
<span class = "pagenum">292</span>

and the Lante (1520) and Altemps (1530), by Peruzzi. But the noblest
creation of this period was the</p>

<a class = "closeup" href = "images/fig167_large.png" target = "_blank">

<p><b>FARNESE PALACE</b>, by many esteemed the finest in Italy. It was
begun in 1530 for Alex. Farnese (Paul III.) by A.&nbsp;da San Gallo the
Younger, with Vignola’s collaboration. The simple but admirable plan is
shown in Fig. 167, and the courtyard, the most imposing in Italy, in
Fig. 168. The exterior is monotonous, but the noble cornice by Michael
Angelo measurably redeems this defect. The fine vaulted columnar
entrance vestibule, the court and the <i>salons</i>, make up an
<i>ensemble</i> worthy of the great architects who designed it. The
loggia toward the river was added by <i>G.&nbsp;della Porta</i> in
1580.</p>


<p><b>VILLAS.</b> The Italian villa of this pleasure-loving period
afforded full scope for the most playful fancies of the architect,
decorator, and landscape gardener. It comprised usually a dwelling,
a&nbsp;<i>casino</i> or amusement-house, and many minor edifices,
summer-houses, arcades, etc., disposed in extensive grounds laid out
with terraces, cascades, and shaded alleys. The style was graceful,
sometimes trivial, but almost always pleasing, making free use of stucco
enrichments, both internally and externally, with abundance of gilding
and frescoing. The <b>Villa Madama</b> (1516), by Raphael, with
stucco-decorations by Giulio Romano, though incomplete and now
dilapidated, is a noted example of the style. More complete, the
<b>Villa of Pope Julius</b>, by Vignola (1550), belongs by its purity of
style to this period; its façade well exemplifies the simplicity,
<span class = "pagenum">293</span>
<a name = "page293" id = "page293"> </a>
dignity, and fine proportions of this master’s work. In addition to
these Roman villas may be mentioned the <b>V. Medici</b> (1540, by
<i>Annibale Lippi</i>; now the French Academy of Rome); the <b>Casino
del Papa</b> in the Vatican Gardens, by <i>Pirro Ligorio</i> (1560); the
<b>V. Lante</b>, near Viterbo, and the <b>V. d’Este</b>, at Tivoli, as
displaying among almost countless others the Italian skill in combining
architecture and gardening.</p>

<p><b>CHURCHES AND CHAPELS.</b> This period witnessed the building of a
few churches of the first rank, but it was especially prolific in
memorial, votive, and sepulchral chapels added to churches already
existing, like the <b>Chigi Chapel</b> of S.&nbsp;M. del Popolo, by
Raphael. The earlier churches of this period generally followed
antecedent types, with the dome as the central feature dominating a
cruciform plan, and simple, unostentatious and sometimes uninteresting
exteriors. Among them may be mentioned: at Pistoia, S.&nbsp;M. del Letto
and <b>S.&nbsp;M. dell’ Umiltà</b>, the latter a fine domical rotunda by
<i>Ventura Vitoni</i> (1509), with an imposing vestibule; at Venice,
<b>S.&nbsp;Salvatore</b>, by <i>Tullio Lombardo</i> (1530), an admirable
edifice with alternating domical and barrel-vaulted bays;
<b>S.&nbsp;Georgio dei Grechi</b> (1536), by <i>Sansovino</i>, and
S.&nbsp;M. Formosa; at Todi, the <b>Madonna della Consolazione</b>
(1510), by <i>Cola da Caprarola</i>, a&nbsp;charming design with a high
dome and four apses; at Montefiascone, the <b>Madonna delle Grazie</b>,
by <i>Sammichele</i> (1523), besides several churches at Bologna,
Ferrara, Prato, Sienna, and Rome of almost or quite equal
<span class = "pagenum">294</span>
<a name = "page294" id = "page294"> </a>
interest. In these churches one may trace the development of the dome as
an external feature, while in <b>S.&nbsp;Biagio</b>, at Montepulciano,
the effort was made by <i>Ant. da San Gallo the Elder</i> to combine
with it the contrasting lines of two campaniles, of which, however, but
one was completed.</p>

FIG. 169.&mdash;ORIGINAL PLAN OF ST. PETER’S, ROME.</p>

<p><b>ST. PETER’S.</b> The culmination of Renaissance church
architecture was reached in <b>St. Peter’s</b>, at Rome. The original
project of Nicholas&nbsp;V. having lapsed with his death, it was the
intention of Julius II. to erect on the same site a stupendous mausoleum
over the monument he had ordered of Michael Angelo. The design of
Bramante, who began its erection in 1506, comprised a Greek cross with
apsidal arms, the four angles occupied by domical chapels and loggias
within a square outline (Fig. 169). The too hasty execution of this
noble design led to the collapse of two of the arches under the dome,
and to long delays after Bramante’s death in 1514. Raphael, Giuliano da
San Gallo, Peruzzi, and A.&nbsp;da San Gallo the Younger successively
supervised the works under the popes from Leo&nbsp;X. to Paul III., and
devised a vast number of plans for its completion. Most of these
involved fundamental alterations of the original scheme, and were
motived by the abandonment of the proposed monument of Julius II.;
a&nbsp;church, and not a mausoleum, being in consequence required. In
1546 Michael Angelo was assigned by Paul III. to the works, and gave
final form to the general design in a simplified
<span class = "pagenum">295</span>
<a name = "page295" id = "page295"> </a>
version of Bramante’s plan with more massive supports, a&nbsp;square
east front with a portico for the chief entrance, and the unrivalled
<b>Dome</b>, which is its most striking feature. This dome, slightly
altered and improved in curvature by della Porta after M.&nbsp;Angelo’s
death in 1564, was completed by <i>D.&nbsp;Fontana</i> in 1604. It is
the most majestic creation of the Renaissance, and one of the greatest
architectural conceptions of all history. It measures 140 feet in
internal diameter, and with its two shells rises from a lofty drum,
buttressed by coupled Corinthian columns, to a height of 405 feet to the
top of the lantern. The church, as left by Michael Angelo, was
harmonious in its proportions, though the single order used internally
and externally dwarfed by its colossal scale the vast dimensions of the
edifice. Unfortunately in 1606 <i>C.&nbsp;Maderna</i> was employed by
Paul&nbsp;V. to lengthen the nave by two bays, destroying the
proportions of the whole, and hiding the dome from view on a near
approach. The present tasteless façade was Maderna’s work. The splendid
atrium or portico added (1629&ndash;67), by <i>Bernini</i>, as an
approach, mitigates but does not cure the ugliness and pettiness of this
front.</p>

The portion below the line <i>A</i>,&nbsp;<i>B</i>, and the side chapels
<i>C</i>,&nbsp;<i>D</i>, were added by Maderna. The remainder represents

<p>St. Peter’s as thus completed (Fig. 170) is the largest
<span class = "pagenum">296</span>
<a name = "page296" id = "page296"> </a>
church in existence, and in many respects is architecturally worthy of
its pre-eminence. The central aisle, nearly 600 feet long, with its
stupendous panelled and gilded vault, 83 feet in span, the vast central
area and the majestic dome, belong to a conception unsurpassed in
majestic simplicity and effectiveness. The construction is almost
excessively massive, but admirably disposed. On the other hand the nave
is too long, and the details not only lack originality and interest, but
are also too large and coarse in scale, dwarfing the whole edifice. The
interior (Fig. 171) is wanting in the sobriety of color that befits so
stately a design; it suggests rather a pagan temple than a Christian
basilica. These faults reveal the decline of taste which had already set
in before Michael Angelo took charge of the work, and which appears even
in the works of that master.</p>


<p><b>THE PERIOD OF FORMAL CLASSICISM.</b> With the middle of the 16th
century the classic orders began to dominate all architectural design.
While Vignola, who wrote a treatise upon the orders, employed them with
unfailing refinement and judgment, his contemporaries showed less
discernment and taste, making of them an end rather than a means. Too
often mere classical correctness was substituted for the fundamental
qualities of original invention ind intrinsic beauty of composition. The
innovation of colossal orders extending through several stories, while
it gave to exterior designs a certain grandeur of scale, tended to
coarseness and even vulgarity of detail. Sculpture and ornament began to
lose their refinement; and while street-architecture gained in
monumental scale, and public squares received a more stately adornment
than ever before, the street-façades individually were too often bare
and uninteresting in their correct formality. In the interiors of
churches and large halls there appears a struggle between a cold and
dignified simplicity and a growing tendency toward pretentious sham. But
these pernicious tendencies did
<span class = "pagenum">299</span>
<a name = "page299" id = "page299"> </a>
not fully mature till the latter part of the century, and the
half-century after 1540 or 1550 was prolific of notable works in both
ecclesiastical and secular architecture. The names of Michael Angelo and
Vignola, whose careers began in the preceding period; of Palladio and
della Porta (1541&ndash;1604) in Rome; of Sammichele and Sansovino in
Verona and Venice, and of Galeazzo Alessi in Genoa, stand high in the
ranks of architectural merit.</p>

<p><b>CHURCHES.</b> The type established by St. Peter’s was widely
imitated throughout Italy. The churches in which a Greek or Latin cross
is dominated by a high dome rising from a drum and terminating in a
lantern, and is treated both internally and externally with Roman
Corinthian pilasters and arches, are almost numberless. Among the best
churches of this type is the <b>Gesù</b> at Rome, by Vignola (1568),
with a highly ornate interior of excellent proportions and a less
interesting exterior, the façade adorned with two stories of orders and
great flanking volutes over the sides (see <a href =
"#page277">p.&nbsp;277</a>). Two churches at Venice, by
<i>Palladio</i>&mdash;<b>S.&nbsp;Giorgio Maggiore</b> (1560; façade by
<i>Scamozzi</i>, 1575) and the <b>Redentore</b>&mdash;offer a strong
contrast to the Gesù, in their cold and almost bare but pure and correct
design. An imitation of Bramante’s plan for St. Peter’s appears in
<b>S.&nbsp;M. di Carignano</b>, at Genoa, by <i>Galeazzo Alessi</i>
(1500&ndash;72), begun 1552, a&nbsp;fine structure, though inferior in
scale and detail to its original. Besides these and other important
churches there were many large domical chapels of great splendor added
to earlier churches; of these the <b>Chapel of Sixtus&nbsp;V.</b> in
S.&nbsp;M. Maggiore, at Rome, by <i>D.&nbsp;Fontana</i>
(1543&ndash;1607), is an excellent example.</p>


<p><b>PALACES: ROME.</b> The palaces on the Capitoline Hill, built at
different dates (1540&ndash;1644) from designs by Michael Angelo,
illustrate the palace architecture of this period, and the imposing
effect of a single colossal order running through two stories. This
treatment, though well adapted
<span class = "pagenum">300</span>
<a name = "page300" id = "page300"> </a>
to produce monumental effects in large squares, was dangerous in its
bareness and heaviness of scale, and was better suited for buildings of
vast dimensions than for ordinary street-façades. In other Roman palaces
of this time the traditions of the preceding period still prevailed, as
in the <b>Sapienza</b> (University), by della Porta (1575), which has a
dignified court and a façade of great refinement without columns or
pilasters. The <b>Papal palaces</b> built by Domenico Fontana on the
Lateran, Quirinal, and Vatican hills, between 1574 and 1590, externally
copying the style of the Farnese, show a similar return to earlier
models, but are less pure and refined in detail than the Sapienza. The
great pentagonal <b>Palace of Caprarola</b>, near Rome, by Vignola, is
perhaps the most successful and imposing production of the Roman classic
school.</p>


<p><b>VERONA.</b> Outside of Rome, palace-building took on various local
and provincial phases of style, of which the most important were the
closely related styles of Verona, Venice, and Vicenza. <i>Michele
Sammichele</i> (1484&ndash;1549), who built in Verona the
<b>Bevilacqua</b>, <b>Canossa</b>, <b>Pompei</b>, and <b>Verzi</b>
palaces and the four chief city gates, and in Venice the
<b>P.&nbsp;Grimani</b>, his masterpiece (1550), was a designer of great
originality and power. He introduced into his military architecture, as
in the gates of Verona, the use of rusticated orders, which he treated
with skill and taste. The idea was copied by later architects and
applied, with doubtful propriety, to palace-façades; though Ammanati’s
garden-façade for the Pitti palace, in Florence (cir. 1560), is an
impressive and successful design.</p>


<p><b>VENICE.</b> Into the development of the maturing classic style
<i>Giacopo Tatti Sansovino</i> (1477&ndash;1570) introduced in his
Venetian buildings new elements of splendor. Coupled columns between
arches themselves supported on columns, and a profusion of figure
sculpture, gave to his palace-façades a hitherto unknown magnificence of
effect, as
<span class = "pagenum">301</span>
<a name = "page301" id = "page301"> </a>
in the <b>Library of St. Mark</b> (now the Royal Palace, Fig. 172), and
the <b>Cornaro</b> palace (P.&nbsp;Corner de Cà Grande), both dating
from about 1530&ndash;40. So strongly did he impress upon Venice these
ornate and sumptuous variations on classic themes, that later architects
adhered, in a very debased period, to the main features and spirit of
his work.</p>

FIG. 172.&mdash;LIBRARY OF ST. MARK, VENICE.</p>


<p><b>VICENZA.</b> Of <i>Palladio’s</i> churches in Venice we have
already spoken; his palaces are mainly to be found in his native city,
Vicenza. In these structures he displayed great fertility of invention
and a profound familiarity with the classic orders, but the degenerate
taste of the Baroque period already begins to show itself in his work.
There is far less of architectural propriety and grace in these
pretentious palaces, with their colossal orders and their affectation of
grandeur, than in the designs of Vignola or Sammichele. Wood and
plaster, used to mimic stone, indicate the approaching reign of sham in
all design (<b>P.&nbsp;Barbarano</b>, 1570; <b>Chieregati</b>, 1560;
<b>Tiene</b>, <b>Valmarano</b>, 1556; <b>Villa Capra</b>). His
masterpiece is the two-storied arcade about the mediæval
<b>Basilica</b>, in which the arches are supported on a minor order
between engaged columns serving
<span class = "pagenum">302</span>
<a name = "page302" id = "page302"> </a>
as buttresses. This treatment has in consequence ever since been known
as the <i>Palladian Motive</i>.</p>


<p><b>GENOA.</b> During the second half of the sixteenth century a
remarkable series of palaces was erected in Genoa, especially notable
for their great courts and imposing staircases. These last were given
unusual prominence owing to differences of level in the courts, arising
from the slope of their sites on the hillside. Many of these palaces
were by Galeazzo Alessi (1502&ndash;72); others by architects of lesser

stairs and loggias, and strong and dignified, if sometimes

<p><b>THE BAROQUE STYLE.</b> A reaction from the cold <i>classicismo</i>
of the late sixteenth century showed itself in the following period, in
the lawless and vulgar extravagances of the so-called <i>Baroque</i>
style. The wealthy Jesuit order was a notorious contributor to the
debasement of architectural taste. Most of the Jesuit churches and many
others not belonging to the order, but following its <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘pernicous’">pernicious</ins> example,
are monuments of bad taste and pretentious sham. Broken
<span class = "pagenum">303</span>
<a name = "page303" id = "page303"> </a>
and contorted pediments, huge scrolls, heavy mouldings, ill-applied
sculpture in exaggerated attitudes, and a general disregard for
architectural propriety characterized this period, especially in its
church architecture, to whose style the name <i>Jesuit</i> is often
applied. Sham marble and heavy and excessive gilding were universal
(Fig. 173). <i>C.&nbsp;Maderna</i> (1556&ndash;1629), <i>Lorenzo
Bernini</i> (1589&ndash;1680), and <i>F.&nbsp;Borromini</i>
(1599&ndash;1667) were the worst offenders of the period, though Bernini
was an artist of undoubted ability, as proved by his colonnades or
atrium in front of St. Peter’s. There were, however, architects of purer
taste whose works even in that debased age were worthy of
admiration.</p>

FIG. 174.&mdash;CHURCH OF S. M. DELLA SALUTE, VENICE.</p>


<p><b>BAROQUE CHURCHES.</b> The Baroque style prevailed in church
architecture for almost two centuries. The majority of the churches
present varieties of the cruciform plan crowned by a high dome which is
usually the best part of the design. Everywhere else the vices of the
period appear in these churches, especially in their façades and
internal decoration. <b>S.&nbsp;M. della Vittoria</b>, by Maderna, and
<b>Sta. Agnese</b>, by Borromini, both at Rome, are examples of the
<span class = "pagenum">304</span>
<a name = "page304" id = "page304"> </a>
style. Naples is particularly full of Baroque churches (Fig. 173),
a&nbsp;few of which, like the <b>Gesù Nuovo</b> (1584), are dignified
and creditable designs. The domical church of <b>S.&nbsp;M. della
Salute</b>, at Venice (1631), by Longhena, is also a majestic edifice in
excellent style (Fig. 174), and here and there other churches offer
exceptions to the prevalent baseness of architecture. Particularly
objectionable was the wholesale disfigurement of existing monuments by
ruthless remodelling, as in S.&nbsp;John Lateran, at Rome, the
cathedrals of Ferrara and Ravenna, and many others.</p>


<p><b>PALACES.</b> These were generally superior to the churches, and
not infrequently impressive and dignified structures. The two best
examples in Rome are the <b>P.&nbsp;Borghese</b>, by <i>Martino Lunghi
the Elder</i> (1590), with a fine court arcade on coupled Doric and
Ionic columns, and the <b>P.&nbsp;Barberini</b>, by Maderna and
Borromini, with an elliptical staircase by Bernini, one of the few
palaces in Italy with projecting lateral wings. In Venice, Longhena, in
the <b>Rezzonico</b> and <b>Pesaro</b> palaces (1650&ndash;80), showed
his freedom from the mannerisms of the age by reproducing successfully
the ornate but dignified style of Sansovino (see <a href =
"#page301">p.&nbsp;301</a>). At Naples D.&nbsp;Fontana, whose works
overlap the Baroque period, produced in the <b>Royal Palace</b> (1600)
and the <b>Royal Museum</b> (1586&ndash;1615) designs of considerable
dignity, in some respects superior to his papal residences in Rome. In
suburban villas, like the <b>Albani</b> and <b>Borghese</b> villas near
Rome, the ostentatious style of the Decline found free and congenial
expression.</p>


<p><b>LATER MONUMENTS.</b> In the few eighteenth-century buildings which
are worthy of mention there is noticeable a reaction from the
extravagances of the seventeenth century, shown in the dignified
correctness of the exteriors and the somewhat frigid splendor of the
interiors. The most notable work of this period is the <b>Royal
Palace</b> at <b>Caserta</b>, by <i>Van Vitelli</i> (1752), an architect
of considerable taste and inventiveness, considering his time. This
great palace, 800
<span class = "pagenum">305</span>
<a name = "page305" id = "page305"> </a>
feet square, encloses four fine courts, and is especially remarkable for
the simple if monotonous dignity of the well proportioned exterior and
the effective planning of its three octagonal vestibules, its ornate
chapel and noble staircase. Staircases, indeed, were among the most
successful features of late Italian architecture, as in the <b>Scala
Regia</b> of the Vatican, and in the Corsini, Braschi, and Barberini
palaces at Rome, the Royal Palace at Naples, etc.</p>

<p>In church architecture the <b>east front</b> of <b>S.&nbsp;John
Lateran</b> in Rome, by <i>Galilei</i> (1734), and the whole
<b>exterior</b> of <b>S.&nbsp;M. Maggiore</b>, by <i>Ferd. Fuga</i>
(1743), are noteworthy designs: the former an especially powerful
conception, combining a colossal order with two smaller orders in
superposed <i>loggie</i>, but marred by the excessive scale of the
statues which crown it. The <b>Fountain</b> of <b>Trevi</b>, conceived
in much the same spirit (1735, by <i>Niccola Salvi</i>), is a striking
piece of decorative architecture. The Sacristy of St. Peter’s, by
<i>Marchionne</i> (1775), also deserves mention as a monumental and not
uninteresting work. In the early years of the present century the
<b>Braccio Nuovo</b> of the Vatican, by <i>Stern</i>, the imposing
church of <b>S.&nbsp;Francesco di Paola</b> at Naples, by
<i>Bianchi</i>, designed in partial imitation of the Pantheon, and the
great <b>S.&nbsp;Carlo Theatre</b> at Naples, show the same coldly
classical spirit, not wholly without merit, but lacking in true
originality and freedom of conception.</p>


<p><b>CAMPANILES.</b> The <b>campaniles</b> of the Renaissance and
Decline deserve at least passing reference, though they are neither
numerous nor often of conspicuous interest. That of the
<b>Campidoglio</b> (Capitol) at Rome, by Martino Lunghi, is a good
example of the classical type. Venetia possesses a number of graceful
and lofty bell-towers, generally of brick with marble bell-stages, of
which the upper part of the <b>Campanile</b> of <b>St. Mark</b> and the
tower of S.&nbsp;Giorgio Maggiore are the finest examples.</p>

<p>The Decline attained what the early Renaissance aimed
<span class = "pagenum">306</span>
<a name = "page306" id = "page306"> </a>
at&mdash;the revival of Roman forms. But it was no longer a Renaissance;
it was a decrepit and unimaginative art, held in the fetters of a
servile imitation, copying the letter rather than the spirit of antique
design. It was the mistaken and abject worship of precedent which
started architecture upon its downward path and led to the atrocious
products of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p><b>ORIGIN AND CHARACTER.</b> The vitality and richness of the Gothic
style in France, even in its decline in the fifteenth century, long
stood in the way of any general introduction of classic forms. When the
Renaissance appeared, it came as a foreign importation, introduced from
Italy by the king and the nobility. It underwent a protracted
transitional phase, during which the national Gothic forms and
traditions were picturesquely mingled with those of the Renaissance. The
campaigns of Charles VIII. (1489), Louis XII. (1499), and
Francis&nbsp;I. (1515), in vindication of their claims to the thrones of
Naples and Milan, brought these monarchs and their nobles into contact
with the splendid material and artistic civilization of Italy, then in
the full tide of the maturing Renaissance. They returned to France,
filled with the ambition to rival the splendid palaces and gardens of
Italy, taking with them Italian artists to teach their arts to the
French. But while these Italians successfully
<span class = "pagenum">309</span>
<a name = "page309" id = "page309"> </a>
introduced many classic elements and details into French architecture,
they wholly failed to dominate the French master-masons and <i>tailleurs
de pierre</i> in matters of planning and general composition. The early
Renaissance architecture of France is consequently wholly unlike the
Italian, from which it derived only minor details and a certain
largeness and breadth of spirit.</p>


<p><b>PERIODS.</b> The French Renaissance and its sequent developments
may be broadly divided into three periods, with subdivisions coinciding
more or less closely with various reigns, as follows:</p>

<p>I. <span class = "smallcaps">The Valois Period</span>, or Renaissance
proper, 1483&ndash;1589, subdivided into:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> <span class = "smallcaps">The Transition</span>, comprising
the reigns of Charles VIII. and Louis XII. (1483&ndash;1515), and the
early years of that of Francis&nbsp;I.; characterized by a picturesque
mixture of classic details with Gothic conceptions.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> <span class = "smallcaps">The Style of Francis I.</span>,
or Early Renaissance, from about 1520 to that king’s death in 1547;
distinguished by a remarkable variety and grace of composition and
beauty of detail.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> <span class = "smallcaps">The Advanced Renaissance</span>,
comprising the reigns of Henry II. (1547), Francis II. (1559), Charles
IX. (1560), and Henry III. (1574&ndash;89); marked by the gradual
adoption of the classic orders and a decline in the delicacy and
richness of the ornament.</p>

<p>II. <span class = "smallcaps">The Bourbon or Classic Period</span>
(1589&ndash;1715):</p>

<p><i>a.</i> <span class = "smallcaps">Style of Henry IV.</span>,
covering his reign and partly that of Louis XIII. (1610&ndash;45),
employing the orders and other classic forms with a somewhat heavy,
florid style of ornament.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> <span class = "smallcaps">Style of Louis XIV.</span>,
beginning in the preceding reign and extending through that of Louis
XIV. (1645&ndash;1715); the great age of classic architecture in France,
corresponding to the Palladian in Italy.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">310</span>
<a name = "page310" id = "page310"> </a>
<p>III. <span class = "smallcaps">The Decline or Rococo Period</span>,
corresponding with the reign of Louis XV. (1715&ndash;74); marked by
pompous extravagance and capriciousness.</p>

<p>During this period a reaction set in toward a severer classicism,
leading to the styles of Louis XVI. and of the Empire, to be treated of
in a later chapter.</p>


<p><b>THE TRANSITION.</b> As early as 1475 the new style made its
appearance in altars, tombs, and rood-screens wrought by French carvers
with the collaboration of Italian artificers. The tomb erected by
Charles of Anjou to his father in Le Mans cathedral (1475, by
<i>Francesco Laurana</i>), the chapel of St. Lazare in the cathedral of
Marseilles (1483), and the tomb of the children of Charles VIII. in
Tours cathedral (1506), by <i>Michel Columbe</i>, the greatest artist of
his time in France, are examples. The schools of Rouen and Tours were
especially prominent in works of this kind, marked by exuberant fancy
and great delicacy of execution. In church architecture Gothic
traditions were long dominant, in spite of the great numbers of Italian
prelates in France. It was in <i>châteaux</i>, palaces, and dwellings
that the new style achieved its most notable triumphs.</p>


<p><b>EARLY CHÂTEAUX.</b> The castle of Charles VIII., at Amboise on the
Loire, shows little trace of Italian influence. It was under Louis XII.
that the transformation of French architecture really began. The
<b>Château de Gaillon</b> (of which unfortunately only fragments remain
in the École des Beaux-Arts at Paris), built for the Cardinal George of
Amboise, between 1497 and 1509, by <i>Pierre Fain</i>, was the
masterwork of the Rouen school. It presented a curious mixture of
styles, with its irregular plan, its moat, drawbridge, and round
corner-towers, its high roofs, turrets, and dormers, which gave it, in
spite of many Renaissance details, a&nbsp;mediæval picturesqueness. The
<b>Château de Blois</b> (the east and south wings of the present group),
begun for Louis XII. about 1500, was the first of a remarkable series
<span class = "pagenum">311</span>
<a name = "page311" id = "page311"> </a>
of royal palaces which are the glory of French architecture. It shows
the new influences in its horizontal lines and flat, unbroken façades of
brick and stone, rather than in its architectural details (Fig. 175).
The <b>Ducal Palace</b> at Nancy and the <b>Hôtel de Ville</b> at
Orléans, by <i>Viart</i>, show a similar commingling of the classic and
mediæval styles.</p>

LOUIS XII.</p>


<p><b>STYLE OF FRANCIS I.</b> Early in the reign of this monarch, and
partly under the lead of Italian artists, like il Rosso, Serlio, and
Primaticcio, classic elements began to dominate the general composition
and Gothic details rapidly disappeared. A&nbsp;simple and effective
system of exterior design was adopted in the castles and palaces of this
period. Finely moulded belt-courses at the sills and heads of the
windows marked the different stories, and were crossed by a system of
almost equally important vertical lines, formed by superposed pilasters
flanking the windows continuously from basement to roof. The façade was
crowned by a slight cornice and open balustrade, above which rose a
steep and lofty roof, diversified by elaborate dormer windows which were
<span class = "pagenum">312</span>
<a name = "page312" id = "page312"> </a>
adorned with gables and pinnacles (<a href =
"#fig178">Fig.&nbsp;178</a>). Slender pilasters, treated like long
panels ornamented with arabesques of great beauty, or with a species of
baluster shaft like a candelabrum, were preferred to columns, and were
provided with graceful capitals of the Corinthianesque type. The
mouldings were minute and richly carved; pediments were replaced by
steep gables, and mullioned windows with stone crossbars were used in
preference to the simpler Italian openings. In the earlier monuments
Gothic details were still used occasionally; and round corner-towers,
high dormers, and numerous turrets and pinnacles appear even in the
châteaux of later date.</p>


<p><b>CHURCHES.</b> Ecclesiastical architecture received but scant
attention under Francis&nbsp;I., and, so far as it was practised, still
clung tenaciously to Gothic principles. Among the few important churches
of this period may be mentioned <b>St. Etienne du Mont</b>, at Paris
(1517&ndash;38), in which classic and Gothic features appear in nearly
equal proportions; the east end of <b>St. Pierre</b>, at Caen, with rich
external carving; and the great parish church of <b>St. Eustache</b>, at
Paris (1532, by <i>Lemercier</i>), in which the plan and construction
are purely Gothic, while the details throughout belong to the new style,
though with little appreciation of the spirit and proportions of classic
art. New façades were also built for a number of already existing
churches, among which <b>St. Michel</b>, at Dijon, is conspicuous, with
its vast portal arch and imposing towers. The Gothic towers of Tours
cathedral were completed with Renaissance lanterns or belfries, the
northern in 1507, the southern in 1547.</p>

FIG. 176.&mdash;STAIRCASE TOWER, BLOIS.</p>

<p><b>PALACES.</b> To the palace at Blois begun by his predecessor,
Francis&nbsp;I. added a northern and a western wing, completing the
court. The north wing is one of the masterpieces of the style,
presenting toward the court a simple and effective composition, with a
rich but slightly projecting cornice and a high roof with elaborate
dormers. This
<span class = "pagenum">313</span>
<a name = "page313" id = "page313"> </a>
façade is divided into two unequal sections by the open <b>Staircase
Tower</b> (Fig. 176), a&nbsp;<i>chef-d’œuvre</i> in boldness of
construction as well as in delicacy and richness of carving. The outer
façade of this wing is a less ornate but more vigorous design, crowned
by a continuous open loggia under the roof. More extensive than Blois
was <b>Fontainebleau</b>, the favorite residence of the king and of many
of his successors. Following in parts the irregular plan of the convent
it replaced, its other portions were more symmetrically disposed, while
the whole was treated externally in a somewhat severe, semi-classic
style, singularly lacking in ornament. Internally, however, this palace,
begun in 1528 by <i>Gilles Le Breton</i>, was at that time the most
splendid in France, the gallery of Francis&nbsp;I. being especially
noted. The <b>Château</b> of <b>St. Germain</b>, near Paris (1539, by
<i>Pierre Chambiges</i>), is of a very different character. Built
largely of brick, with flat balustraded roof and deep buttresses
carrying three ranges of arches, it is neither Gothic nor classic,
neither fortress nor palace in aspect, but a wholly unique
conception.</p>

attesting the inventiveness of the French genius, expressing itself in a
new-found language, whose formal canons it disdained. Chief among them
is the <b>Château of Chambord</b> (Figs. 177, 178)&mdash;“a Fata Morgana
in the midst of a wild, woody thicket,” to use Lübke’s language. This
extraordinary edifice, resembling in plan a feudal castle with
curtain-walls, bastions, moat, and donjon, is in its architectural
treatment a palace with arcades, open-stair towers, a&nbsp;noble double
spiral staircase terminating in a graceful lantern, and a roof of the
most bewildering complexity of towers, chimneys, and dormers (1526, by
<i>Pierre le Nepveu</i>). The hunting-lodges of La Muette and Chalvau,
and the so-called <b>Château de Madrid</b>&mdash;all three demolished
during or since the Revolution&mdash;deserve mention, especially
<span class = "pagenum">315</span>
<a name = "page315" id = "page315"> </a>
the last. This consisted of two rectangular pavilions, connected by a
lofty banquet-hall, and adorned externally with arcades in Florentine
style, and with medallions and reliefs of della Robbia ware (1527, by
<i>Gadyer</i>).</p>

<p><b>THE LOUVRE.</b> By far the most important of all the architectural
enterprises of this reign, in ultimate results, if not in original
extent, was the beginning of a new palace to replace the old Gothic
fortified palace of the Louvre. To this task Pierre Lescot was summoned
in 1542, and the work of erection actually begun in 1546. The new
palace, in a sumptuous and remarkably dignified classic style, was to
have covered precisely the area of the demolished fortress. Only the
southwest half, comprising two sides of the court, was, however,
undertaken at the outset (Fig. 179). It remained for later monarchs to
amplify the original scheme, and ultimately to complete, late in the
present century, the most extensive and beautiful of all the royal
residences of Europe. (See Figs. <a href = "#fig181">181</a>, <a href =

<p>Want of space forbids more than a passing reference to the rural
castles of the nobility, rivalling those of the king. Among them Bury,
La Rochefoucauld, Bournazel, and
<span class = "pagenum">316</span>
<a name = "page316" id = "page316"> </a>
especially <b>Azay-le-Rideau</b> (1520) and <b>Chenonceaux</b>
(1515&ndash;23), may be mentioned, all displaying that love of rural
pleasure, that hatred of the city and its confinement, which so
distinguish the French from the Italian Renaissance.</p>


<p><b>OTHER BUILDINGS.</b> The <b>Hôtel-de-Ville</b> (town hall), of
Paris, begun during this reign, from plans by <i>Domenico di Cortona</i>
(?), and completed under Henry IV., was the most important edifice of a
class which in later periods numbered many interesting structures. The
town hall of <b>Beaugency</b> (1527) is one of the best of minor public
buildings in France, and in its elegant treatment of a simple
two-storied façade may be classed with the <b>Maison
François&nbsp;I.</b>, at Paris. This stood formerly at Moret, whence it
was transported to Paris and re-erected about 1830 in somewhat modified
form. The large city houses of this period are legion; we can mention
only the Hôtel Carnavalet at Paris; the Hôtel Bourgtheroude at Rouen;
the Hôtel d’Écoville at Caen; the archbishop’s palace at Sens, and a
number of houses in Orléans. The <b>Tomb of Louis XII.</b>, at St.
Denis, deserves especial mention for its fine proportions and beautiful
arabesques.</p>


<p><b>THE ADVANCED RENAISSANCE.</b> By the middle of the sixteenth
century the new style had lost much of its earlier charm. The orders,
used with increasing frequency, were more and more conformed to antique
precedents. Façades were flatter and simpler, cornices more pronounced,
arches more Roman in treatment, and a heavier style of carving took the
place of the delicate arabesques of the preceding age. The reigns of
Henry II. (1547&ndash;59) and Charles IX. (1560&ndash;74) were
especially distinguished by the labors of three celebrated architects:
<i>Pierre Lescot</i> (1515&ndash;78), who continued the work on the
southwest angle of the Louvre; <i>Jean Bullant</i> (1515&ndash;78), to
whom are due the right wing of Ecouen and the porch of colossal
Corinthian columns in the left wing of the same, built under
Francis&nbsp;I.; and, finally, <i>Philibert de l’Orme</i>
(1515&ndash;70). <i>Jean Goujon</i> (1510&ndash;72) also
<span class = "pagenum">317</span>
<a name = "page317" id = "page317"> </a>
executed during this period most of the remarkable architectural
sculptures which have made his name one of the most illustrious in the
annals of French art. Chief among the works of de l’Orme was the palace
of the <b>Tuileries</b>, built under Charles IX. for Cathérine de
Médicis, not far from the Louvre, with which it was ultimately connected
by a long gallery. Of the vast plan conceived for this palace, and
comprising a succession of courts and wings, only a part of one side was
erected (1564&ndash;72). This consisted of a domical pavilion, flanked
by low wings only a story and a half high, to which were added two
stories under Henry IV., to the great advantage of the design. Another
masterpiece was the <b>Château d’Anet</b>, built in 1552 by Henry II.
for Diane de Poitiers, of which, unfortunately, only fragments survive.
This beautiful edifice, while retaining the semi-military moat and
bastions of feudal tradition, was planned with classic symmetry, adorned
with superposed orders, court arcades, and rectangular corner-pavilions,
and provided with a domical cruciform chapel, the earliest of its class
in France. All the details were unusually pure and correct, with just
enough of freedom and variety to lend a charm wanting in later works of
the period. To the reign of Henry II. belong also the châteaux of
Ancy-le-Franc, Verneuil, Chantilly (the “petit château,” by Bullant),
the banquet-hall over the bridge at Chenonceaux (1556), several notable
residences at Toulouse, and the tomb of Francis&nbsp;I. at St. Denis.
The châteaux of <b>Pailly</b> and <b>Sully</b>, distinguished by the
sobriety and monumental quality of their composition, in which the
orders are important elements, belong to the reign of Charles IX.,
together with the Tuileries, already mentioned.</p>

<p><b>THE CLASSIC PERIOD: HENRY IV.</b> Under this energetic but
capricious monarch (1589&ndash;1610) and his Florentine queen, Marie de
Médicis, architecture entered upon a new period of activity and a new
stage of development. Without the
<span class = "pagenum">318</span>
<a name = "page318" id = "page318"> </a>
charm of the early Renaissance or the stateliness of the age of Louis
XIV., it has a touch of the Baroque, attributable partly to the
influence of Marie de Médicis and her Italian prelates, and partly to
the Italian training of many of the French architects. The great work of
this period was the extension of the Tuileries by <i>J.&nbsp;B. du
Cerceau</i>, and the completion, by <i>Métézeau</i> and others, of the
long gallery next the Seine, begun under Henry II., with the view of
connecting the Tuileries with the Louvre. In this part of the work
colossal orders were used with indifferent effect. Next in importance
was the addition to Fontainebleau of a great court to the eastward,
whose relatively quiet and dignified style offers less contrast than one
might expect to the other wings and courts dating from Francis&nbsp;I.
More successful architecturally than either of the above was the
<b>Luxemburg</b> palace, built for the queen by <i>Salomon De
Brosse</i>, in 1616 (Fig. 180). Its plan presents the favorite French
arrangement of a main building separated from the street
<span class = "pagenum">319</span>
<a name = "page319" id = "page319"> </a>
by a garden or court, the latter surrounded on three sides by low wings
containing the dependencies. Externally, rusticated orders recall the
garden front of the Pitti at Florence; but the scale is smaller, and the
projecting pavilions and high roofs give it a grace and picturesqueness
wanting in the Florentine model. The <b>Place Royale</b>, at Paris, and
the château of Beaumesnil, illustrate a type of brick-and-stone
architecture much in vogue at this time, stone quoins decorating the
windows and corners, and the orders being generally omitted.</p>

<p>Under Louis XIII. the Tuileries were extended northward and the
Louvre as built by Lescot was doubled in size by the architect
<i>Lemercier</i>, the Pavillon de l’Horloge being added to form the
centre of the enlarged court façade.</p>


<p><b>CHURCHES.</b> To this reign belong also the most important
churches of the period. The church of <b>St. Paul-St. Louis</b>, at
Paris (1627, by <i>Derrand</i>), displays the worst faults of the time,
in the overloaded and meaningless decoration of its uninteresting front.
Its internal dome is the earliest in Paris. Far superior was the chapel
of the <b>Sorbonne</b>, a&nbsp;well-designed domical church by
<i>Lemercier</i>, with a sober and appropriate exterior treated with
superposed orders.</p>


<p><b>PERIOD OF LOUIS XIV.</b> This was an age of remarkable literary
and artistic activity, pompous and pedantic in many of its
manifestations, but distinguished also by productions of a very high
order. Although contemporary with the Italian Baroque&mdash;Bernini
having been the guest of Louis XIV.&mdash;the architecture of this
period was free from the wild extravagances of that style. In its often
cold and correct dignity it resembled rather that of Palladio, making
large use of the orders in exterior design, and tending rather to
monotony than to overloaded decoration. In interior design there was
more of lightness and caprice. Papier-maché and stucco were freely used
in a fanciful style of relief ornamentation by scrolls, wreaths, shells,
etc., and
<span class = "pagenum">320</span>
<a name = "page320" id = "page320"> </a>
decorative panelling was much employed. The whole was saved from
triviality only by the controlling lines of the architecture which
framed it. But it was better suited to cabinet-work or to the
prettinesses of the boudoir than to monumental interiors. The <b>Galerie
d’Apollon</b>, built during this reign over the Petite Galerie in the
Louvre, escapes this reproach, however, by the sumptuous dignity of its
interior treatment.</p>


<p><b>VERSAILLES.</b> This immense edifice, built about an already
existing villa of Louis XIII., was the work of <i>Levau</i> and
<i>J.&nbsp;H. Mansart</i> (1647&ndash;1708). Its erection, with the
laying out of its marvellous park, almost exhausted the resources of the
realm, but with results quite incommensurate with the outlay. In spite
of its vastness, its exterior is commonplace; the orders are used with
singular monotony, which is not redeemed by the deep breaks and
projections of the main front. There is no controlling or dominant
feature; there is no adequate entrance or approach; the grand staircases
are badly placed and unworthily treated, and the different elements of
the plan are combined with singular lack of the usual French sense of
monumental and rational arrangement. The chapel is by far the best
single feature in the design.</p>

<p>Far more successful was the completion of the Louvre, in 1688, from
the designs of <i>Claude Perrault</i>, the court physician, whose plans
were fortunately adopted in preference to those of Bernini. For the east
front he designed a magnificent Corinthian colonnade nearly 600 feet
long, with coupled columns upon a plain high basement, and with a
central pediment and terminal pavilions (Fig. 181). The whole forms one
of the most imposing façades in existence; but it is a mere decoration,
having no practical relation to the building behind it. Its height
required the addition of a third story to match it on the north and
south sides of the court, which as thus completed quadrupled the
original area
<span class = "pagenum">321</span>
<a name = "page321" id = "page321"> </a>
proposed by Lescot. Fortunately the style of Lescot’s work was retained
throughout in the court façades, while externally the colonnade was
recalled on the south front by a colossal order of pilasters. The Louvre
as completed by Louis XIV. was a stately and noble palace, as remarkable
for the surpassing excellence of the sculptures of Jean Goujon as for
the dignity and beauty of its architecture. Taken in connection with the
Tuileries, it was unrivalled by any palace in Europe except the
Vatican.</p>

<p><b>OTHER BUILDINGS.</b> To Louis XIV. is also due the vast but
uninteresting <b>Hôtel des Invalides</b> or veteran’s asylum, at Paris,
by J.&nbsp;H. Mansart. To the chapel of this institution was added, in
1680&ndash;1706, the celebrated <b>Dome</b> of the Invalides,
a&nbsp;masterpiece by the same architect. In plan it somewhat resembles
Bramante’s scheme for St. Peter’s&mdash;a&nbsp;Greek cross with domical
chapels in the four angles and a dome over the centre. The exterior
(Fig. 182), with the lofty gilded dome on a high drum adorned with
engaged columns, is somewhat high for its breadth, but is a
<span class = "pagenum">322</span>
<a name = "page322" id = "page322"> </a>
harmonious and impressive design; and the interior, if somewhat cold, is
elegant and well proportioned. The chief innovation in the design was
the wide separation of the interior stone dome from the lofty exterior
decorative cupola and lantern of wood, this separation being designed to
meet the conflicting demands of internal and external effect. To the
same architect is due the formal monotony of the <b>Place Vendôme</b>,
all the houses surrounding it being treated with a uniform architecture
of colossal pilasters, at once monumental and inappropriate. One of the
most pleasing designs of the time is the <b>Château de Maisons</b>
(1658), by <i>F.&nbsp;Mansart</i>, uncle of J.&nbsp;H. Mansart. In this
the proportions of the central and terminal pavilions, the mass and
lines of the steep roof <i>à&nbsp;la Mansarde</i>, the simple and
effective use of the orders, and the refinement of all the details
impart a grace of aspect rare in contemporary works. The same qualities
appear also in the <b>Val-de-Grâce</b>, by F.&nbsp;Mansart and
Lemercier, a&nbsp;domical church of excellent proportions begun under
Louis XIII. The want of space forbids mention of other buildings of this
period.</p>

<p><b>THE DECLINE.</b> Under Louis XV. the pedantry of the classic
period gave place to a protracted struggle between license and the
severest classical correctness. The exterior designs of this time were
often even more uninteresting and bare than under Louis XIV.; while, on
the other hand, interior decoration tended to the extreme of
extravagance and disregard of constructive propriety. Contorted lines
and crowded scrolls, shells, and palm-leaves adorned the mantelpieces,
cornices, and ceilings, to the almost complete suppression of straight
lines.</p>

FIG. 183.&mdash;FAÇADE OF ST. SULPICE, PARIS.</p>

<p>While these tendencies prevailed in many directions,
a&nbsp;counter-current of severe classicism manifested itself in the
designs of a number of important public buildings, in which it was
sought to copy the grandeur of the old Roman colonnades and arcades. The
important church of <b>St. Sulpice</b> at Paris (Fig. 183) is an
excellent example of this. Its interior, dating from the preceding
century, is well designed, but in no wise a remarkable composition,
following Italian models. The façade, added in 1755 by
<i>Servandoni</i>, is, on the other hand, one of the most striking
architectural objects in the city. It is a correct and well proportioned
classic composition in two stories&mdash;an Ionic arcade over a Doric
colonnade, surmounted by two lateral turrets. Other monuments of this
classic revival will be noticed in Chapter XXV.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">324</span>
<a name = "page324" id = "page324"> </a>
<p><b>PUBLIC SQUARES.</b> Much attention was given to the embellishment
of open spaces in the cities, for which the classic style was admirably
suited. The most important work of this kind was that on the north side
of the Place de la Concorde, Paris. This splendid square, perhaps, on
the whole, the finest in Europe (though many of its best features belong
to a later date), was at this time adorned with the two monumental
colonnades by <i>Gabriel</i>. These colonnades, which form the
decorative fronts for blocks of houses, deserve praise for the beauty of
their proportions, as well as for the excellent treatment of the arcade
on which they rest, and of the pavilions at the ends.</p>


<p><b>IN GENERAL.</b> French Renaissance architecture is marked by good
proportions and harmonious and appropriate detail. Its most interesting
phase was unquestionably that of Francis&nbsp;I., so far, at least, as
concerns exterior design. It steadily progressed, however, in its
mastery of planning; and in its use of projecting pavilions crowned by
dominant masses of roof, it succeeded in preserving, even in severely
classic designs, a&nbsp;picturesqueness and variety otherwise
impossible. Roofs, dormers, chimneys, and staircases it treated with
especial success; and in these matters, as well as in monumental
dispositions of plan, the French have largely retained their
pre-eminence to our own day.</p>

<p><b>THE TRANSITION.</b> The architectural activity of the sixteenth
century in England was chiefly devoted to the erection of vast country
mansions for the nobility and wealthy <i>bourgeoisie</i>. In these
seignorial residences a degenerate form of the Gothic, known as the
Tudor style, was employed during the reigns of Henry VII. and Henry
VIII., and they still retained much of the feudal aspect of the Middle
Ages. This style, with its broad, square windows and ample halls, was
well suited to domestic architecture, as well as to collegiate
buildings, of which a considerable number were erected at this time.
Among the more important palaces and manor-houses of this period are the
earlier parts of Hampton Court, Haddon and Hengreave Halls, and the now
ruined castles of Raglan and Wolterton.</p>

<p><b>ELIZABETHAN STYLE.</b> Under Elizabeth (1558&ndash;1603) the
progress of classic culture and the employment of Dutch
<span class = "pagenum">327</span>
<a name = "page327" id = "page327"> </a>
and Italian artists led to a gradual introduction of Renaissance forms,
which, as in France, were at first mingled with others of Gothic origin.
Among the foreign artists in England were the versatile Holbein, Trevigi
and Torregiano from Italy, and Theodore Have, Bernard Jansen, and Gerard
Chrismas from Holland. The pointed arch disappeared, and the orders
began to be used as subordinate features in the decoration of doors,
windows, chimneys, and mantels. Open-work balustrades replaced
externally the heavy Tudor battlements, and a peculiar style of carving
in flat relief-patterns, resembling <i>appliqué</i> designs cut out with
the jigsaw and attached by nails or rivets, was applied with little
judgment to all possible features. Ceilings were commonly finished in
plaster, with elaborate interlacing patterns in low relief; and this,
with the increasing use of interior woodwork, gave to the mansions of
this time a more homelike but less monumental aspect internally. English
<span class = "pagenum">328</span>
<a name = "page328" id = "page328"> </a>
architects, like Smithson and Thorpe, now began to win the patronage at
first monopolized by foreigners. In <b>Wollaton Hall</b> (1580), by
Smithson, the orders were used for the main composition with mullioned
windows, much after the fashion of <b>Longleat House</b>, completed a
year earlier by his master, John of Padua. During the following period,
however (1590&ndash;1610), there was a reaction toward the Tudor
practice, and the orders were again relegated to subordinate uses. Of
their more monumental employment, the <b>Gate of Honor</b> of Caius
College, Cambridge, is one of the earliest examples. Hardwicke and
Charlton Halls, and Burghley, Hatfield, and Holland Houses (Fig. 184),
are noteworthy monuments of the style.</p>


<p><b>JACOBEAN STYLE.</b> During the reign of James&nbsp;I.
(1603&ndash;25), details of classic origin came into more general use,
but caricatured almost beyond recognition. The orders, though much
employed, were treated without correctness or grace, and the ornament
was unmeaning and heavy. It is not worth while to dwell further upon
this style, which produced no important public buildings, and soon gave
way to a more rigid classicism.</p>

FIG. 185.&mdash;BANQUETING HALL, WHITEHALL.</p>

<p><b>CLASSIC PERIOD.</b> If the classic style was late in its
appearance in England, its final sway was complete and long-lasting. It
was <i>Inigo Jones</i> (1572&ndash;1652) who first introduced the
correct and monumental style of the Italian masters of classic design.
For Palladio, indeed, he seems to have entertained a sort of veneration,
and the villa which he designed at Chiswick was a reduced copy of
Palladio’s Villa Capra, near Vicenza. This and other works of his show a
failure to appreciate the unsuitability of Italian conceptions to the
climate and tastes of Great Britain; his efforts to popularize Palladian
architecture, without the resources which Palladio controlled in the way
of decorative sculpture and painting, were consequently not always happy
in their results. His greatest work was the design
<span class = "pagenum">329</span>
<a name = "page329" id = "page329"> </a>
for a new <b>Palace at Whitehall</b>, London. Of this colossal scheme,
which, if completed, would have ranked as the grandest palace of the
time, only the <b>Banqueting Hall</b> (now used as a museum) was ever
built (Fig. 185). It is an effective composition in two stories,
rusticated throughout and adorned with columns and pilasters, and
contains a fine vaulted hall in three aisles. The plan of the palace,
which was to have measured 1,152 × 720 feet, was excellent, largely
conceived and carefully studied in its details, but it was wholly beyond
the resources of the kingdom. The garden-front of <b>Somerset House</b>
(1632; demolished) had the same qualities of simplicity and dignity,
recalling the works of Sammichele. Wilton House, Coleshill, the Villa at
Chiswick, and St. Paul’s, Covent Garden, are the best known of his
works, showing him to have been a designer of ability, but hardly of the
consummate genius which his admirers attribute to him.</p>

FIG. 186.&mdash;PLAN OF ST. PAUL’S, LONDON.</p>

<p><b>ST. PAUL’S CATHEDRAL.</b> The greatest of Jones’s successors was
<i>Sir Christopher Wren</i> (1632&ndash;1723), principally known as the
architect of <b>St. Paul’s Cathedral</b>, London, built to replace the
earlier Gothic cathedral destroyed in the great fire of 1666. It was
begun in 1675, and its designer had the rare good fortune to witness its
completion in 1710. The plan, as finally adopted, retained the general
<span class = "pagenum">330</span>
<a name = "page330" id = "page330"> </a>
proportions of an English Gothic church, measuring 480 feet in length,
with transepts 250 feet long, and a grand rotunda 108 feet in diameter
at the crossing (Fig. 186). The style was strictly Italian, treated with
sobriety and dignity, if somewhat lacking in variety and inspiration.
Externally two stories of the Corinthian order appear, the upper story
being merely a screen to hide the clearstory and its buttresses. This is
an architectural deception, not atoned for by any special beauty of
detail. The dominant feature of the design is the dome over the central
area. It consists of an inner shell, reaching a height of 216 feet,
above which rises the exterior dome of wood, surmounted by a stone
lantern, the summit of which is 360 feet from the pavement (Fig. 187).
This exterior dome, springing from a high drum surrounded by a
magnificent peristyle, gives to the otherwise commonplace exterior of
the cathedral a signal majesty of effect. Next to the dome the most
successful part of the design is the west front, with its two-storied
porch and flanking bell-turrets. Internally the excessive relative
length, especially that of the choir, detracts from the effect of the
dome, and the poverty of detail gives the whole a somewhat bare aspect.
It is intended to relieve this ultimately by a systematic use of mosaic
decoration, especially in the dome. The central area itself, in spite of
the awkward treatment of the four smaller arches of the eight which
support the dome, is a noble design, occupying the whole width of the
three aisles, like the Octagon at Ely, and producing a striking effect
of amplitude
<span class = "pagenum">331</span>
<a name = "page331" id = "page331"> </a>
and grandeur. The dome above it is constructively interesting from the
employment of a cone of brick masonry to support the stone lantern which
rises above the exterior wooden shell. The lower part of the cone forms
the drum of the inner dome, its contraction upward being intended to
produce a perspective illusion of increased height.</p>

<p><b>WREN’S OTHER WORKS.</b> Wren was conspicuously successful in the
designing of parish churches in London. <b>St. Stephen’s</b>, Walbrook,
is the most admired of these, with a dome resting on eight columns. Wren
may be called the inventor of the English Renaissance type of steeple,
in which a conical or pyramidal spire is harmoniously added
<span class = "pagenum">332</span>
<a name = "page332" id = "page332"> </a>
to a belfry on a square tower with classic details. The steeple of
<b>Bow Church</b>, Cheapside, is the most successful example of the
type. In secular architecture Wren’s most important works were the plan
for rebuilding London after the Great Fire; the new courtyard of Hampton
Court, a&nbsp;quiet and dignified composition in brick and stone; the
pavilions and colonnade of <b>Greenwich Hospital</b>; the Sheldonian
Theatre at Oxford, and the Trinity College Library at Cambridge. Without
profound originality, these works testify to the sound good taste and
intelligence of their designer.</p>

<p><b>THE 18TH CENTURY.</b> The Anglo-Italian style as used by Jones and
Wren continued in use through the eighteenth century, during the first
half of which a number of important country-seats and some churches were
erected. <i>Van Brugh</i> (1666&ndash;1726), <i>Hawksmoor</i>
(1666&ndash;1736), and <i>Gibbs</i> (1683&ndash;1751) were then the
leading architects. Van Brugh was especially skilful in his dispositions
of plan and mass, and produced in the designs of Blenheim and Castle
Howard effects of grandeur and variety of perspective hardly equalled by
any of his contemporaries in France or Italy. <b>Blenheim</b>, with its
monumental plan and the sweeping curves of its front (Fig. 188), has an
unusually palatial aspect, though the striving for picturesqueness is
carried too far. Castle Howard is simpler, depending largely for effect
on a somewhat inappropriate dome. To Hawksmoor, his pupil, are due
<b>St. Mary’s, Woolnoth</b> (1715), at London, in which by a bold
rustication of the whole exterior and by windows set in
<span class = "pagenum">333</span>
<a name = "page333" id = "page333"> </a>
large recessed arches he was enabled to dispense wholly with the orders;
St. George’s, Bloomsbury; the new quadrangle of All Souls at Oxford, and
some minor works. The two most noted designs of James Gibbs are <b>St.
Martin’s-in-the-Fields</b>, at London (1726), and the <b>Radcliffe
Library</b>, at Oxford (1747). In the former the use of a Corinthian
portico&mdash;a&nbsp;practically uncalled-for but decorative
appendage&mdash;and of a steeple mounted on the roof, with no visible
lines of support from the ground, are open to criticism. But the
excellence of the proportions, and the dignity and appropriateness of
the composition, both internally and externally, go far to redeem these
defects (Fig. 189). The Radcliffe Library is a circular domical hall
surrounded by a lower circuit of alcoves and rooms, the whole treated
with straightforward simplicity and excellent proportions. Colin
Campbell, Flitcroft, Kent and Wood, contemporaries of Gibbs, may be
dismissed with passing mention.</p>

<p><i>Sir William Chambers</i> (1726&ndash;96) was the greatest of the
later 18th-century architects. His fame rests chiefly on his <i>Treatise
on Civil Architecture</i>, and the extension and remodelling of
<b>Somerset House</b>, in which he retained the general
<i>ordonnance</i> of Inigo Jones’s design, adapting it to a
<span class = "pagenum">334</span>
<a name = "page334" id = "page334"> </a>
frontage of some 600 feet. <i>Robert <ins class = "correction" title =
"consistent error for ‘Adam’">Adams</ins></i>, the designer of
Keddlestone Hall, <i>Robert Taylor</i> (1714&ndash;88), the architect of
the Bank of England, and <i>George Dance</i>, who designed the Mansion
House and Newgate Prison, at London&mdash;the latter a vigorous and
appropriate composition without the orders&mdash;close the list of noted
architects of the eighteenth century. It was a period singularly wanting
in artistic creativeness and spontaneity; its productions were nearly
all dull and respectable, or at best dignified, but without charm.</p>


<p><b>BELGIUM.</b> As in all other countries where the late Gothic style
had been highly developed, Belgium was slow to accept the principles of
the Renaissance in art. Long after the dawn of the sixteenth century the
Flemish architects continued to employ their highly florid Gothic alike
for churches and town-halls, with which they chiefly had to do. The
earliest Renaissance buildings date from 1530&ndash;40, among them being
the Hôtel du Saumon, at Malines, at Bruges the Ancien Greffe, by <i>Jean
Wallot</i>, and at Liège the <b>Archbishop’s Palace</b>, by
<i>Borset</i>. The last named, in the singular and capricious form of
the arches and baluster-like columns of its court, reveals the taste of
the age for what was <i>outré</i> and odd; a&nbsp;taste partly due, no
doubt, to Spanish influences, as Belgium was in reality from 1506 to
1712 a Spanish province, and there was more or less interchange of
artists between the two countries. The <b>Hôtel de Ville</b>, at
Antwerp, by <i>Cornelius de Vriendt</i> or <i>Floris</i>
(1518&ndash;75), erected in 1565, is the most important monument of the
Renaissance in Belgium. Its façade, 305 feet long and 102 feet high, in
four stories, is an impressive creation in spite of its somewhat
monotonous fenestration and the inartistic repetition in the third story
of the composition and proportions of the second. The basement story
forms an open arcade, and an open colonnade or loggia runs along under
the roof, thus imparting to the composition a considerable play of light
and shade, enhanced by the picturesque
<span class = "pagenum">335</span>
<a name = "page335" id = "page335"> </a>
central pavilion which rises to a height of six stories in diminishing
stages. The style is almost Palladian in its severity, but in general
the Flemish architects disdained the restrictions of classic canons,
preferring a more florid and fanciful effect than could be obtained by
mere combinations of Roman columns, arches, and entablatures. De
Vriendt’s other works were mostly designs for altars, tabernacles and
the like; among them the rood screen in Tournay Cathedral. His influence
may be traced in the Hôtel<!-- invisible accent --> de Ville at Flushing
(1594).</p>

FIG. 190.&mdash;RENAISSANCE HOUSES, BRUSSELS.</p>

<p>The ecclesiastical architecture of the Flemish Renaissance is almost
as destitute of important monuments as is the secular. <b>Ste. Anne</b>,
at Bruges, fairly illustrates the type, which is characterized in
general by heaviness of detail and a cold and bare aspect internally.
The Renaissance in Belgium is best exemplified, after all, by minor
works and ordinary dwellings, many of which have considerable artistic
grace, though they are quaint rather than monumental (Fig. 190). Stepped
gables, high dormers, and volutes flanking each diminishing stage of the
design, give a certain piquancy to the street architecture of the
period.</p>


<p><b>HOLLAND.</b> Except in the domain of realistic painting, the Dutch
have never manifested pre-eminent artistic endowments, and the
Renaissance produced in Holland few monuments of consequence. It began
there, as in many
<span class = "pagenum">336</span>
<a name = "page336" id = "page336"> </a>
other places, with minor works in the churches, due largely to Flemish
or Italian artists. About the middle of the 16th century two native
architects, <i>Sebastian van Noye</i> and <i>William van Noort</i>,
first popularized the use of carved pilasters and of gables or steep
pediments adorned with carved scallop-shells, in remote imitation of the
style of Francis&nbsp;I. The principal monuments of the age were
town-halls, and, after the war of independence in which the yoke of
Spain was finally broken (1566&ndash;79), local administrative
buildings&mdash;mints, exchanges and the like. The <b>Town Hall</b> of
<b>The Hague</b> (1565), with its stepped gable or great dormer, its
consoles, statues, and octagonal turrets, may be said to have
inaugurated the style generally followed after the war. Owing to the
lack of stone, brick was almost universally employed, and stone imported
by sea was only used in edifices of exceptional cost and importance. Of
these the <b>Town Hall</b> at Amsterdam holds the first place. Its
façade is of about the same dimensions as the one at Antwerp, but
compares unfavorably with it in its monotony and want of interest. The
<b>Leyden Town Hall</b>, by the Fleming, <i>Lieven de Key</i> (1597),
the Bourse or Exchange and the Hanse House at Amsterdam, by <i>Hendrik
de Keyser</i>, are also worthy of mention, though many lesser buildings,
built of brick combined with enamelled terra-cotta and stone, possess
quite as much artistic merit.</p>


<p><b>DENMARK.</b> In Denmark the monuments of the Renaissance may
almost be said to be confined to the reign of Christian IV.
(1588&ndash;1648), and do not include a single church of any importance.
The royal castles of the <b>Rosenborg</b> at Copenhagen (1610) and the
<b>Fredericksborg</b> (1580&ndash;1624), the latter by a Dutch
architect, are interesting and picturesque in mass, with their fanciful
gables, mullioned windows and numerous turrets, but can hardly lay claim
to beauty of detail or purity of style. The Exchange at Copenhagen,
built of brick and stone in the same general
<span class = "pagenum">337</span>
<a name = "page337" id = "page337"> </a>
style (1619&ndash;40), is still less interesting both in mass and
detail.</p>

<p>The only other important Scandinavian monument deserving of special
mention in so brief a sketch as this is the <b>Royal Palace</b> at
<b>Stockholm</b>, Sweden (1698&ndash;1753), due to a foreign architect,
<i>Nicodemus de Tessin</i>. It is of imposing dimensions, and although
simple in external treatment, it merits praise for the excellent
disposition of its plan, its noble court, imposing entrances, and the
general dignity and appropriateness of its architecture.</p>

<p><b>AUSTRIA</b>; <b>BOHEMIA</b>. The earliest appearance of the
Renaissance in the architecture of the German states was in the eastern
provinces. Before the close of the fifteenth century Florentine and
Milanese architects were employed in Austria, Bohemia, and the Tyrol,
where there are a number of palaces and chapels in an unmixed Italian
style. The portal of the castle of Mahrisch-Trübau dates from 1492;
while to the early years of the 16th century belong a cruciform chapel
at Gran, the remodelling of the castle at Cracow, and the chapel of the
Jagellons in the same city&mdash;the earliest domical structure of the
German Renaissance, though of Italian design. The <b>Schloss Porzia</b>
(1510), at Spital in Carinthia, is a fine quadrangular palace,
surrounding a court with arcades on three sides, in which the open
stairs form a picturesque interruption with their rampant arches. But
for the massiveness of the details it might be a Florentine palace. In
addition to this, the famous <b>Arsenal</b> at Wiener-Neustadt (1524),
the portal of the Imperial
<span class = "pagenum">339</span>
<a name = "page339" id = "page339"> </a>
Palace (1552), and the <b>Castle Schalaburg</b> on the Danube
(1530&ndash;1601), are attributed to Italian architects, to whom must
also be ascribed a number of important works at Prague. Chief among
these the <b>Belvedere</b> (1536, by <i>Paolo della Stella</i>),
a&nbsp;rectangular building surrounded by a graceful open arcade, above
which it rises with a second story crowned by a curved roof; the
Waldstein Palace (1621&ndash;29), by <i>Giov. Marini</i>, with its
imposing loggia; <b>Schloss Stern</b>, built on the plan of a
six-pointed star (1459&ndash;1565) and embellished by Italian artists
with stucco ornaments and frescoes; and parts of the palace on the
Hradschin, by <i>Scamozzi</i>, attest the supremacy of Italian art in
Bohemia. The same is true of Styria, Carinthia, and the Tyrol;
<i>e.g.</i> <b>Schloss Ambras</b> at Innsbrück (1570).</p>


<p><b>GERMANY: PERIODS.</b> The earliest manifestation of the
Renaissance in what is now the German Empire, appeared in the works of
painters like Dürer and Burkmair, and in occasional buildings previous
to 1525. The real transformation of German architecture, however, hardly
began until after the Peace of Augsburg, in 1555. From that time on its
progress was rapid, its achievements being almost wholly in the domain
of secular architecture&mdash;princely and ducal castles, town halls or
<i>Rathhäuser</i>, <!-- invisible umlaut --> and houses of wealthy
burghers or corporations. It is somewhat singular that the German
emperors should not have undertaken the construction of a new imperial
residence on a worthy scale, the palaces of Munich and Berlin being
aggregations of buildings of various dates about a nucleus of mediæval
origin, and with no single portion to compare with the stately châteaux
of the French kings. Church architecture was neglected, owing to the
Reformation, which turned to its own uses the existing churches, while
the Roman Catholics were too impoverished to replace the edifices they
had lost.</p>

<p>The periods of the German Renaissance are less well
<span class = "pagenum">340</span>
<a name = "page340" id = "page340"> </a>
marked than those of the French; but its successive developments follow
the same general progression, divided into three stages:</p>

<p>I. <span class = "smallcaps">The Early Renaissance</span>,
1525&ndash;1600, in which the orders were infrequently used, mainly for
porches and for gable decoration. The conceptions and spirit of most
monuments were still strongly tinged with Gothic feeling.</p>

<p>II. <span class = "smallcaps">The Late Renaissance</span>,
1600&ndash;1675, characterized by a dry, heavy treatment, in which too
often neither the fanciful gayety of the previous period nor the simple
and monumental dignity of classic design appears. Broken curves, large
scrolls, obelisks, and a style of flat relief carving resembling the
Elizabethan are common. Occasional monuments exhibit a more correct and
classic treatment after Italian models.</p>

<p>III. <span class = "smallcaps">The Decline or Baroque Period</span>,
1675&ndash;1800, employing the orders in a style of composition
oscillating between the extremes of bareness and of Rococo
over-decoration. The ornament partakes of the character of the Louis XV.
and Italian Jesuit styles, being most successful in interior decoration,
but externally running to the extreme of unrestrained fancy.</p>

<p><b>CHARACTERISTICS.</b> In none of these periods do we meet with the
sober, monumental treatment of the Florentine or Roman schools.
A&nbsp;love of picturesque variety in masses and sky-lines, inherited
from mediæval times, appears in the high roofs, stepped gables and lofty
dormers which are universal. The roofs often comprise several stories,
and are lighted by lofty gables at either end, and by dormers carried up
from the side walls through two or three stories. Gables and dormers
alike are built in diminishing stages, each step adorned with a console
or scroll, and the whole treated with pilasters or colonnettes and
entablatures breaking over each support (Fig. 191). These roofs,
dormers, and gables contribute the most noticeable element to the
general
<span class = "pagenum">341</span>
<a name = "page341" id = "page341"> </a>
effect of most German Renaissance buildings, and are commonly the
best-designed features in them. The orders are scantily used and usually
treated with utter disregard of classic canons, being generally far too
massive and overloaded with ornament. Oriels, bay-windows, and turrets,
starting from corbels or colonnettes, or rarely from the ground,
diversify the façade, and spires of curious bulbous patterns give added
piquancy to the picturesque sky-line. The plans seldom had the
monumental symmetry and largeness of Italian and French models;
courtyards were often irregular in shape and diversified with balconies
and spiral staircase-turrets. The national leaning was always toward the
quaint and fantastic, as well in the decoration as in the composition.
Grotesques, caryatids, <i>gaînes</i> (half-figures terminating below in
sheath-like supports), fanciful rustication, and many other details give
a touch of the Baroque even to works of early date. The same principles
were applied with better success to interior decoration, especially in
the large halls of
<span class = "pagenum">342</span>
<a name = "page342" id = "page342"> </a>
the castles and town-halls, and many of their ceilings were sumptuous
and well-considered designs, deeply panelled, painted and gilded in wood
or plaster.</p>


<p><b>CASTLES.</b> The <i>Schloss</i> or <i>Burg</i> of the German
prince or duke retained throughout the Renaissance many mediæval
characteristics in plan and aspect. A&nbsp;large proportion of these
noble residences were built upon foundations of demolished feudal
castles, reproducing in a new dress the ancient round towers and vaulted
guard-rooms and halls, as in the Hartenfels at Torgau, the Heldburg
(both in Saxony), and the castle of Trausnitz, in Bavaria, among many
others. The <b>Castle</b> at <b>Torgau</b> (1540) is one of the most
imposing of its class, with massive round and square towers showing
externally, and court façades full of picturesque irregularities. In the
great <b>Castle</b> at <b>Dresden</b> the plan is more symmetrical, and
the Renaissance appears more distinctly in the details of the
Georgenflügel (1530&ndash;50), though at that early date the classic
orders were almost ignored. The portal of the Heldburg, however, built
in 1562, is a composition quite in the contemporary French vein, with
superposed orders and a crowning pediment over a massive basement.</p>

<p>Another important series of castles or palaces are of more regular
design, in which the feudal traditions tend to disappear. The majority
belong to the end of the 16th and beginning of the 17th centuries. They
are built around large rectangular courts with arcades in two or three
stories on one or more sides, but rarely surrounding it entirely. In
these the segmental arch is more common than the semicircular, and
springs usually from short and stumpy Ionic or Corinthian columns. The
rooms and halls are arranged <i>en suite</i>, without corridors, and a
large and lofty banquet hall forms the dominant feature of the series.
The earliest of these regularly planned palaces are of Italian design.
Chief among them is the <b>Residenz</b> at <b>Landshut</b>
(1536&ndash;43),
<span class = "pagenum">343</span>
<a name = "page343" id = "page343"> </a>
with a thoroughly Roman plan, by pupils of Giulio Romano, and exterior
and court façades of great dignity treated with the orders. More German
in its details, but equally interesting, is the <b>Fürstenhof</b> <!--
missing umlaut --> at <b>Wismar</b>, in brick and terra-cotta, by
<i>Valentino di Lira</i> and <i>Van Aken</i> (1553); while in the
<b>Piastenschloss</b> at Brieg (1547&ndash;72), by Italian architects,
the treatment in parts suggests the richest works of the style of
Francis&nbsp;I. In other castles the segmental arch and stumpy columns
or piers show the German taste, as in the <b>Plassenburg</b>, by
<i>Kaspar Vischer</i> (1554&ndash;64), the castle at Plagnitz, and the
<b>Old Castle</b> at <b>Stuttgart</b>, all dating from about
1550&ndash;55. <b>Heidelberg Castle</b>, in spite of its mediæval aspect
from the river and its irregular plan, ranks as the highest achievement
of the German Renaissance in palace design. The most interesting parts
among its various wings built at different dates&mdash;the earlier
portions still Gothic in design&mdash;are the <b>Otto Heinrichsbau</b>
(1554) and the <b>Friedrichsbau</b> (1601). The first of these appears
somewhat simpler in its lines than the second, by reason of having lost
its original dormer-gables. The orders, freely treated, are superposed
in three stories, and twin windows, niches, statues, <i>gaînes</i>,
medallions and profuse carving produce an effect of great gayety and
richness. The Friedrichsbau (Fig. 192), less quiet in its lines, and
with high scroll-gabled and stepped dormers, is on the other hand more
soberly decorated and more characteristically German. The Schloss
Hämelschenburg (<a href = "#fig191">Fig.&nbsp;191</a>) is designed in
somewhat the same spirit, but with even greater simplicity of
detail.</p>

<p><b>TOWN HALLS.</b> These constitute the most interesting class of
Renaissance buildings in Germany, presenting a considerable variety of
types, but nearly all built in solid blocks without courts, and adorned
with towers or spires. A&nbsp;high roof crowns the building, broken by
one or more high gables or many-storied dormers. The majority of these
town
<span class = "pagenum">344</span>
<a name = "page344" id = "page344"> </a>
halls present façades much diversified by projecting wings, as at Lemgo
and Paderborn, or by oriels and turrets, as at <b>Altenburg</b>
(1562&ndash;64); and the towers which dominate the whole terminate
usually in bell-shaped cupolas, or in more capricious forms with
successive swellings and contractions, as at Dantzic (1587). A&nbsp;few,
however, are designed with monumental simplicity of mass; of these that
at <b>Bremen</b> (1612) is perhaps the finest, with its beautiful
exterior arcade on strong Doric columns. The town hall of Nuremberg is
one of the few with a court, and presents a façade of almost Roman
simplicity (1613&ndash;19); that at <b>Augsburg</b> (1615) is equally
classic and more pleasing; while at Schweinfurt, Rothenburg (1572),
Mülhausen, etc., are others worthy of mention.</p>


<p><b>CHURCHES.</b> <b>St. Michael’s</b>, at Munich, is almost the only
important church of the first period in Germany (1582), but it is worthy
to rank with many of the most notable contemporary Italian churches.
A&nbsp;wide nave covered by a majestic barrel vault, is flanked by side
chapels, separated from each other by massive piers and
<span class = "pagenum">345</span>
<a name = "page345" id = "page345"> </a>
forming a series of gallery bays above. There are short transepts and a
choir, all in excellent proportion and treated with details which, if
somewhat heavy, are appropriate and reasonably correct. The
<b>Marienkirche</b> at Wolfenbüttel <!-- missing umlaut --> (1608) is a
fair sample of the parish churches of the second period. In the exterior
of this church pointed arches and semi-Gothic tracery are curiously
associated with heavy rococo carving. The simple rectangular mass,
square tower, and portal with massive orders and carving are
characteristic features. Many of the church-towers are well proportioned
and graceful structures in spite of the fantastic outlines of their
spires. One of the best and purest in style is that of the University
Church at Würzburg (1587&ndash;1600).</p>


<p><b>HOUSES.</b> Many of the German houses of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries would merit extended notice in a larger work, as
among the most interesting lesser monuments of the Renaissance.
Nuremberg and Hildesheim are particularly rich in such houses, built
either for private citizens or for guilds and corporations. Not a few of
the half-timbered houses of the time are genuine works of art, though
interest chiefly centres in the more monumental
<span class = "pagenum">346</span>
<a name = "page346" id = "page346"> </a>
dwellings of stone. In this domestic architecture the picturesque
quality of German design appears to better advantage than in more
monumental edifices, and their broadly stepped gables, corbelled oriels,
florid portals and want of formal symmetry imparting a peculiar and
undeniable charm. The Kaiserhaus and Wedekindsches Haus at Hildesheim;
<b>Fürstenhaus</b> at Leipzig; Peller, Hirschvogel, and Funk houses at
Nuremberg; the Salt House at Frankfurt, and Ritter House at Heidelberg,
are a few of the most noted among these examples of domestic
architecture.</p>

FIG. 193.&mdash;ZWINGER PALACE, DRESDEN.</p>

<p><b>LATER MONUMENTS.</b> The <b>Zwinger Palace</b> at Dresden (Fig.
193), is the most elaborate and wayward example of the German palace
architecture of the third period. Its details are of the most
exaggerated rococo type, like confectioner’s work done in stone; and yet
the building has an air of princely splendor which partly atones for its
details. Besides this palace, Dresden possesses in the domical
<b>Marienkirche</b> (Fig. 194) a&nbsp;very meritorious example of late
design. The proportions are good, and the detail, if not interesting, is
at least inoffensive, while the whole is
<span class = "pagenum">347</span>
<a name = "page347" id = "page347"> </a>
a&nbsp;dignified and rational piece of work. At Vienna are a number of
palaces of the third period, more interesting for their beautiful
grounds and parks than for intrinsic architectural merit. As in Italy,
this was the period of stucco, and although in Vienna this cheap and
perishable material was cleverly handled, and the ornament produced was
often quaint and effective, the results lack the permanence and dignity
of true building in stone or brick, and may be dismissed without further
mention.</p>

<p>In minor works the Germans were far less prolific than the Italians
or Spaniards. Few of their tombs were of the first importance, though
one, the <b>Sebald Shrine</b>, in Nuremberg, by <i>Peter Vischer</i>
(1506&ndash;19), is a splendid work in bronze, in the transitional
style; a&nbsp;richly decorated canopy on slender metal colonnettes
covering and enclosing the sarcophagus of the saint. There are a large
number of fountains in the squares of German and Swiss cities which
display a high order of design, and are among the most characteristic
minor products of German art.</p>


<p><b>SPAIN.</b> The flamboyant Gothic style sufficed for a while to
meet the requirements of the arrogant and luxurious period which in
Spain followed the overthrow of the Moors and the discovery of America.
But it was inevitable that the Renaissance should in time make its
influence felt in the arts of the Iberian peninsula, largely through the
employment of Flemish artists. In jewelry and silverwork, arts which
received a great impulse from the importation of the precious metals
from the New World, the forms of the Renaissance found special
acceptance, so that the new style received the name of the
<i>Plateresque</i> (from <i>platero</i>, silversmith). This was a not
inept name for the minutely detailed and sumptuous decoration of the
early Renaissance, which lasted from 1500 to the accession of Philip II.
in 1556. It was characterized by surface-decoration spreading over broad
areas, especially around doors and windows,
<span class = "pagenum">348</span>
<a name = "page348" id = "page348"> </a>
florid escutcheons and Gothic details mingling with delicately chiselled
arabesques. Decorative pilasters with broken entablatures and carved
baluster-shafts were employed with little reference to constructive
lines, but with great refinement of detail, in spite of the exuberant
profusion of the ornament.</p>

<p>To this style, after the artistic inaction of Philip II.’s reign,
succeeded the coldly classic style practised by <i>Berruguete</i> and
<i>Herrera</i>, and called the <i>Griego-Romano</i>. In spite of the
attempt to produce works of classical purity, the buildings of this
period are for the most part singularly devoid of originality and
interest. This style lasted until the middle of the seventeenth century,
and in the case of certain works and artists, until its close. It was
followed, at least in ecclesiastical architecture, by the so-called
<i>Churrigueresque</i>, a&nbsp;name derived from an otherwise
insignificant architect, <i>Churriguera</i>, who like Maderna and
Borromini in Italy, discarded all the proprieties of architecture, and
rejoiced in the wildest extravagances of an untrained fancy and debased
taste.</p>


<p><b>EARLY MONUMENTS.</b> The earliest ecclesiastical works of the
Renaissance period, like the cathedrals of Salamanca, Toledo, and
Segovia, were almost purely Gothic in style. Not until 1525 did the new
forms begin to dominate in cathedral design. The cathedral at
<b>Jaen</b>, by <i>Valdelvira</i> (1525), an imposing structure with
three aisles and side chapels, was treated internally with the
Corinthian order throughout. The Cathedral of <b>Granada</b> (1529, by
<i>Diego de Siloe</i>) is especially interesting for its great domical
sanctuary 70 feet in diameter, and for the largeness and dignity of its
conception and details. The cathedral of Malaga, the church of San
Domingo at Salamanca, and the monastery of San Girolamo in the same city
are either wholly or in part Plateresque, and provided with portals of
especial richness of decoration. Indeed, the portal of S.&nbsp;Domingo
practically forms the whole façade.</p>

SALAMANCA.</p>

<p>In secular architecture the <b>Hospital</b> of <b>Santa Cruz</b> at
Toledo, by <i>Enrique de Egaz</i> (1504&ndash;16), is one of the
earliest examples of the style. Here, as also in the <b>University</b>
at <b>Salamanca</b> (Fig. 195), the portal is the most notable feature,
suggesting both Italian and French models in its details. The great
<b>College</b> at <b>Alcala de Heñares</b> is another important early
monument of the Renaissance (1500&ndash;17, by <i>Pedro Gumiel</i>). In
most designs the preference was for long façades of moderate height,
with a basement showing few openings, and a <i>bel étage</i> lighted by
large windows widely spaced. Ornament was chiefly concentrated about the
doors and windows, except for the roof balustrades, which were often
exceedingly elaborate. Occasionally a decorative motive is spread over
the whole façade, as in the <b>Casa de las Conchas</b> at Salamanca,
adorned with cockle-shells carved at intervals all over the
front&mdash;a&nbsp;bold and effective device; or the Infantada palace
with its spangling of carved diamonds. The courtyard or <i>patio</i> was
an indispensable feature of these buildings, as in all hot countries,
and was surrounded
<span class = "pagenum">350</span>
<a name = "page350" id = "page350"> </a>
by arcades frequently of the most fanciful design overloaded with minute
ornament, as in the <b>Infantado</b> at Guadalajara, the <b>Casa de
Zaporta</b>, formerly at Saragossa (now removed to Paris; Fig. 196), and
the Lupiana monastery. The patios in the <b>Archbishop’s Palace</b> at
Alcala de Heñares and the <b>Collegio de los Irlandeses</b> at Salamanca
are of simpler design; that of the <b>Casa de Pilatos</b> at Seville is
almost purely Moorish. Salamanca abounds in buildings of this
period.</p>

<p><b>THE GRIEGO-ROMANO.</b> The more classic treatment of architectural
designs by the use of the orders was introduced by <i>Alonzo
Berruguete</i> (1480&ndash;1560?), who studied in Italy after 1503. The
Archbishop’s Palace and the Doric <b>Gate</b> of <b>San Martino</b>,
both at Toledo, were his work, as well as the first palace at Madrid.
The Palladio of Spain was, however, by <i>Juan de Herrera</i> (died
1597), the architect of <b>Valladolid Cathedral</b>, built under
Philip&nbsp;V. This vast edifice follows the general lines of the
earlier cathedrals of Jaen and Granada, but in a style of classical
correctness almost
<span class = "pagenum">351</span>
<a name = "page351" id = "page351"> </a>
severe in aspect, but well suited to the grand scale of the church. The
masterpiece of this period was the monastery of the <b>Escurial</b>,
begun by <i>Juan Battista</i> of Toledo, in 1563, but not completed
until nearly one hundred and fifty years later. Its final architectural
aspect was largely due to Herrera. It is a vast rectangle of 740 × 580
feet, comprising a complex of courts, halls, and cells, dominated by the
huge mass of the chapel. This last is an imposing domical church
covering 70,000 square feet, treated throughout with the Doric order,
and showing externally a lofty dome and campaniles with domical
lanterns, which serve to diversify the otherwise monotonous mass of the
monastery. What the Escurial lacks in grace or splendor is at least in a
measure redeemed by its majestic scale and varied sky-lines. The
<b>Palace of Charles&nbsp;V.</b> (Fig. 197), adjoining the Alhambra at
Granada, though begun as early as 1527 by <i>Machuca</i>, was mainly due
to Berruguete, and is an excellent example of the Spanish Palladian
style. With its circular court, admirable proportions and well-studied
details, this often maligned edifice deserves to be ranked among the
most successful examples of the style. During this period the cathedral
of Seville received many alterations, and the upper part of the
adjoining

<p>Of the <b>Palace</b> at <b>Madrid</b>, rebuilt by Philip&nbsp;V.
after the burning of the earlier palace in 1734, and mainly the work of
an Italian, <i>Ivara</i>; the Aranjuez palace (1739, by <i>Francisco
Herrera</i>), and the Palace at <b>San Ildefonso</b>, it need only be
said that their chief merit lies in their size and the absence of those
glaring violations of good taste which generally characterized the
successors of Churriguera. In ecclesiastical design these violations of
taste were particularly abundant and excessive, especially in the
façades and in the sanctuary&mdash;huge aggregations of misplaced and
vulgar detail, with hardly an unbroken pediment, column, or arch in the
whole. Some extreme examples of this abominable style are to be found in
the Spanish-American churches of the 17th and 18th centuries, as at
Chihuahua (Mexico), Tucson (Arizona), and other places. The least
offensive features of the churches of this period were the towers,
usually in pairs at the west end, some of them showing excellent
proportions and good composition in spite of their execrable
details.</p>

<p>Minor architectural works, such as the rood screens in the churches
of Astorga and Medina de Rio Seco, and many tombs at Granada, Avila,
Alcala, etc., give evidence of superior skill in decorative design,
where constructive considerations did not limit the exercise of the
imagination.</p>


<p><b>PORTUGAL.</b> The Renaissance appears to have produced few notable
works in Portugal. Among the chief of these are the <b>Tower</b>, the
church, and the <b>Cloister</b>, at Belem. These display a riotous
profusion of minute carved ornament, with a free commingling of late
Gothic details, wearisome in the end in spite of the beauty of its
execution (1500&ndash;40?). The church of <b>Santa Cruz</b> at Coimbra,
and that of <b>Luz</b>, near Lisbon, are among the most noted of the

<p><b>THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.</b> By the end of the seventeenth century
the Renaissance, properly speaking, had run its course in Europe. The
increasing servility of its imitation of antique models had exhausted
its elasticity and originality. Taste rapidly declined before the growth
of the industrial and commercial spirit in the eighteenth century. The
ferment of democracy and the disquiet of far-reaching political changes
had begun to preoccupy the minds of men to the detriment of the arts. By
the middle of the eighteenth century, however, the extravagances of the
Rococo, Jesuit, and Louis XV. styles had begun to pall upon the popular
taste. The creative spirit was dead, and nothing seemed more promising
as a corrective for these extravagances than a return to classic models.
But the demand was for a literal copying of the arcades and porticos of
Rome, to serve as frontispieces for buildings in which modern
requirements should be accommodated to these antique exteriors, instead
of controlling the design. The result was a manifest gain in the
splendor of the streets and squares adorned by these highly decorative
frontispieces, but at the expense of convenience
<span class = "pagenum">355</span>
<a name = "page355" id = "page355"> </a>
and propriety in the buildings themselves. While this academic spirit
too often sacrificed logic and originality to an arbitrary symmetry and
to the supposed canons of Roman design, it also, on the other hand, led
to a stateliness and dignity in the planning, especially in the
designing of vestibules, stairs, and halls, which render many of the
public buildings it produced well worthy of study. The architecture of
the Roman Revival was pompous and artificial, but seldom trivial, and
its somewhat affected grandeur was a welcome relief from the dull
extravagance of the styles it replaced.</p>


<p><b>THE GREEK REVIVAL.</b> The Roman revival was, however, displaced
in England and Germany by the Greek Revival, which set in near the close
of the eighteenth century. This was the result of a newly awakened
interest in the long-neglected monuments of Attic art which the
discoveries of Stuart and Revett&mdash;sent out in 1732 by the London
Society of Dilettanti&mdash;had once more made known to the world. It
led to a veritable <i>furore</i> in England for Greek Doric and Ionic
columns, which were applied indiscriminately to every class of
buildings, with utter disregard of propriety. The British taste was at
this time at its lowest ebb, and failed to perceive the poverty of Greek
architecture when deprived of its proper adornments of carving and
sculpture, which were singularly lacking in the British examples.
Nevertheless the Greek style in England had a long run of popular favor,
yielding only during the reign of the present sovereign to the so-called
Victorian Gothic, a&nbsp;revival of mediæval forms. In Germany the Greek
Revival was characterized by a more cultivated taste and a more rational
application of its forms, which were often freely modified to suit
modern needs. In France, where the Roman Revival under Louis XV. had
produced fairly satisfactory results, and where the influence of the
Royal School of Fine Arts (<i>École des Beaux-Arts</i>) tended to
perpetuate the
<span class = "pagenum">356</span>
<a name = "page356" id = "page356"> </a>
principles of Roman design, the Greek Revival found no footing. The
Greek forms were seen to be too severe and intractable for present
requirements. About 1830, however, a&nbsp;modified style of design,
known since as the <i>Néo-Grec</i>, was introduced by the exertions of a
small coterie of talented architects; and though its own life was short,
it profoundly influenced French art in the direction of freedom and
refinement for a long time afterward. In Italy there was hardly anything
in the nature of a true revival of either Roman or Greek forms. The few
important works of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
were conceived in the spirit of the late Renaissance, and took from the
prevalent revival of classicism elsewhere merely a greater correctness
of detail, not any radical change of form or spirit.</p>

<p><b>ENGLAND.</b> There was, strictly speaking, no Roman revival in
Great Britain. The modified Palladian style of Wren and Gibbs and their
successors continued until superseded by the Greek revival. The first
fruit of the new movement seems to have been the <b>Bank of England</b>
at London, by <i>Sir John Soane</i> (1788). In this edifice the
Greco-Roman order of the round temple at Tivoli was closely copied, and
applied to a long façade, too low for its length and with no sufficient
stylobate, but fairly effective with its recessed colonnade and
unpierced walls. The <b>British Museum</b>, by <i>Robert Smirke</i>
(Fig. 198), was a more ambitious essay in a more purely Greek style. Its
colossal Ionic colonnade was, however, a&nbsp;mere frontispiece, applied
to a badly planned and commonplace building, from which it cut off
needed light. The more modest but appropriate columnar façade to the
<b>Fitzwilliam Museum</b> at Cambridge, by <i>Bassevi</i>, was a more
successful attempt in the same direction, better proportioned and
avoiding the incongruity of modern windows in several stories. These
have always been the stumbling-block of the revived Greek style. The
<span class = "pagenum">357</span>
<a name = "page357" id = "page357"> </a>
difficulties they raise are avoided, however, in buildings presenting
but two stories, the order being applied to the upper story, upon a high
stylobate serving as a basement. The <b>High School</b> and the Royal
Institution at Edinburgh, and the University at London, by
<i>Wilkins</i>, are for this reason, if for no other, superior to the
British Museum and other many-storied Anglo-Greek edifices. In spite of
all difficulties, however, the English extended the applications of the
style with doubtful success not only to all manner of public buildings,
but also to country residences. Carlton House, Bowden Park, and Grange
House are instances of this misapplication of Greek forms. Neither did
it prove more tractable for ecclesiastical purposes. <b>St.
Pancras’s</b> Church at London, and several churches by <i>Thomson</i>
(1817&ndash;75), in Glasgow, though interesting as experiments in such
adaptation, are not to be commended for imitation. The most successful
of all British Greek designs is perhaps <b>St. George’s
<span class = "pagenum">358</span>
<a name = "page358" id = "page358"> </a>
Hall</b> at Liverpool (Fig. 199), whose imposing peristyle and porches
are sufficiently Greek in spirit and detail to class it among the works
of the Greek Revival. But its great hall and its interior composition
are really Roman and not Greek, emphasizing the teaching of experience
that Greek architecture does not lend itself to the exigencies of modern
civilization to nearly the same extent as the Roman.</p>

<p><b>GERMANY.</b> During the eighteenth century the classic revival in
Germany, which at first followed Roman precedents (as in the columns
carved with spirally ascending reliefs in front of the church of <b>St.
Charles Borromeo</b>, at Vienna), was directed into the channel of Greek
imitation by the literary works of Winckelmann, Lessing, Goethe, and
others, as well as by the interest aroused by the discoveries of Stuart
and Revett. The <b>Brandenburg Gate</b> at Berlin (1784, by Langhans)
was an early example of this Hellenism in architecture, and one of its
most successful applications to civic purposes. Without precisely
copying any Greek structure, it was evidently inspired from the Athenian
Propylæa, and nothing in its purpose is foreign to the style employed.
The greatest activity in the style came later, however, and was greatly
stimulated by the achievements of <i>Fr. Schinkel</i> (1771&ndash;1841),
one of the greatest of modern German architects.
<span class = "pagenum">359</span>
<a name = "page359" id = "page359"> </a>
While in the domical church of St. Nicholas at Potsdam, he employed
Roman forms in a modernized Roman conception, and followed in one or two
other buildings the principles of the Renaissance, his predilections
were for Greek architecture. His masterpiece was the <b>Museum</b> at
Berlin, with an imposing portico of 18 Ionic columns (Fig. 200). This
building with its fine rotunda was excellently planned, and forms, in
conjunction with the <b>New Museum</b> by <i>Stuhler</i>
(1843&ndash;55), a&nbsp;noble palace of art, to whose monumental
requirements and artistic purpose the Greek colonnades and pediments
were not inappropriate. Schinkel’s greatest successor was <i>Leo von
Klenze</i> (1784&ndash;1864), whose more textual reproductions of Greek
models won him great favor and wide employment. The <b>Walhalla</b> near
Ratisbon is a modernized Parthenon, internally vaulted with glass;
elegant externally, but too obvious a plagiarism to be greatly admired.
The <b>Ruhmeshalle</b> at Munich, a&nbsp;double <span class =
"sans">L</span> partly enclosing a colossal statue of Bavaria, and
devoted to the commemoration of Bavaria’s great men, is copied from no
Greek building, though purely Greek in design and correct to the
smallest detail. In the <b>Glyptothek</b> (Sculpture Gallery), in the
same city, the one distinctively
<span class = "pagenum">360</span>
<a name = "page360" id = "page360"> </a>
Greek feature introduced by Klenze, an Ionic portico, is also the one
inappropriate note in the design. The <b>Propylæa</b> at Munich, by the
same (Fig. 201), and the <b>Court Theatre</b> at Berlin, by Schinkel,
are other important examples of the style. The latter is externally one
of the most beautiful theatres in Europe, though less ornate than many.
Schinkel’s genius was here remarkably successful in adapting Greek
details to the exigent difficulties of theatre design, and there is no
suggestion of copying any known Greek building.</p>

<p>In Vienna the one notable monument of the Classic Revival is the
<b>Reichsrathsgebäude</b> or Parliament House, by <i>Th. Hansen</i>
(1843), an imposing two-storied composition with a lofty central
colonnade and lower side-wings, harmonious in general proportions and
pleasingly varied in outline and mass.</p>

<p>In general, the Greek Revival in Germany presents the aspect of a
sincere striving after beauty, on the part of a limited number of
artists of great talent, misled by the idea
<span class = "pagenum">361</span>
<a name = "page361" id = "page361"> </a>
that the forms of a dead civilization could be galvanized into new life
in the service of modern needs. The result was disappointing, in spite
of the excellent planning, admirable construction and carefully studied
detail of these buildings, and the movement here as elsewhere was
foredoomed to failure.</p>

<p><b>FRANCE.</b> In France the Classic Revival, as we have seen, had
made its appearance during the reign of Louis XV. in a number of
important monuments which expressed the protest of their authors against
the caprice of the Rococo style then in vogue. The colonnades of the
Garde-Meuble, the façade of St. Sulpice, and the coldly beautiful
<b>Panthéon</b> (Figs. 202, 203) testified to the conviction in the most
cultured minds of the time that Roman grandeur was to be attained only
by copying the forms of Roman architecture with the closest possible
approach to correctness. In the Panthéon, the greatest ecclesiastical
monument of its time in France (otherwise known as the church of Ste.
Genéviève), the spirit of correct classicism dominates the interior as
well as the exterior. It is a Greek cross, measuring 362 × 267 feet,
with a dome 265 feet high, and internally 69 feet in diameter. The four
arms have domical vaulting and narrow aisles separated by Corinthian
columns. The whole interior is a cold but extremely elegant composition.
The most notable features of the exterior are its imposing portico of
colossal Corinthian columns and the fine peristyle which surrounds the
drum of the dome, giving it great dignity and richness of effect.</p>

<p>The dome, which is of stone throughout, has three shells, the
intermediate shell serving to support the heavy stone lantern. The
architect was <i>Soufflot</i> (1713&ndash;81). The <b>Grand Théâtre</b>,
at Bordeaux (1773, by <i>Victor Louis</i>), one of the largest and
finest theatres in Europe, was another product of this movement, its
stately colonnade forming one of the chief ornaments of the city. Under
Louis XVI. there was a temporary reaction from this somewhat pompous
affectation of antique grandeur; but there were few important buildings
erected during that unhappy reign, and the reaction showed itself mainly
in a more delicate and graceful style of interior decoration. It was
reserved for the Empire to set the seal of official approval on the
Roman Revival.

FIG. 204.&mdash;ARC DE L’ÉTOILE, PARIS.<!-- invisible all . --></span>
The Arch of Triumph of the Carrousel, behind the Tuileries, by
<i>Percier and Fontaine</i>, the magnificent Arc de l’Étoile, at the
summit of the Avenue of the Champs Elysées, by <i>Chalgrin</i>; the wing
begun by Napoleon to connect the Tuileries with the Louvre on the land
side, and the church of the Madeleine, by <i>Vignon</i>, erected as a
temple to the heroes of the Grande Armée, were all designed, in
accordance with the expressed will of the Emperor himself, in a style as
Roman as the requirements
<span class = "pagenum">363</span>
<a name = "page363" id = "page363"> </a>
of each case would permit. All these monuments, begun between 1806 and
1809, were completed after the Restoration. The <b>Arch</b> of the
<b>Carrousel</b> is a close copy of Roman models; that of the
<b>Étoile</b> (Fig. 204) was a much more original design, of colossal
dimensions. Its admirable proportions, simple composition and striking
sculptures give it a place among the noblest creations of its class. The
<b>Madeleine</b> (Fig. 205), externally a Roman Corinthian temple of the
largest size, presents internally an almost Byzantine conception with
the three pendentive domes that vault its vast nave, but all the details
are Roman. However suitable for a pantheon or mausoleum, it seems
strangely inappropriate as a design for a Christian church. To these
monuments should be added the <b>Bourse</b> or Exchange, by
<i>Brongniart</i>, heavy in spite of its Corinthian peristyle, and the
river front of the <b>Corps Législatif</b> or Palais Bourbon, by
<i>Poyet</i>, the only extant example of a dodecastyle portico with a
pediment. All of these designs are characterized by great elegance of
detail and excellence of execution, and however inappropriate in style
to modern uses, they add immensely to the splendor of the French
capital. Unquestionably no feature can take the place of a Greek or
Roman
<span class = "pagenum">364</span>

colonnade as an embellishment for broad avenues and open squares, or as

<p>The Greek revival took little hold of the Parisian imagination. Its
forms were too cold, too precise and fixed, too intractable to modern
requirements to appeal to the French taste. It counts but one notable
monument, the church of <b>St. Vincent de Paul</b>, by <i>Hittorff</i>,
who sought to apply to this design the principles of Greek external
polychromy; but the frescoes and ornaments failed to withstand the
Parisian climate, and were finally erased. The Néo-Grec movement already
referred to, initiated by Duc, Duban, and Labrouste about 1830, aimed
only to introduce into modern design the spirit and refinement, the
purity and delicacy of Greek art, not its forms (Fig. 206). Its chief
monuments were the remodelling, by <i>Duc</i>, of the <b>Palais de
Justice</b>, of which the new west façade is the most striking single
feature; the beautiful <b>Library of the École des Beaux-Arts</b>, by
<i>Duban</i>; the
<span class = "pagenum">365</span>
<a name = "page365" id = "page365"> </a>
library of <b>Ste. Genéviève</b>, by <i>Labrouste</i>, in which a long
façade is treated without a pilaster or column, simple arches over a
massive basement forming the dominant motive, while in the interior a
system of iron construction with glazed domes controls the design; and
the commemorative <b>Colonne Juillet</b>, by Duc, the most elegant and
appropriate of all modern memorial columns. All these buildings, begun
between 1830 and 1850 and completed at various dates, are distinguished
by a remarkable purity and freedom of conception and detail, quite
unfettered by the artificial trammels of the official academic style
then prevalent.</p>

<p><b>THE CLASSIC REVIVAL ELSEWHERE.</b> The other countries of Europe
have little to show in the way of imitations of classic monuments or
reproductions of Roman colonnades. In Italy the church of
<b>S.&nbsp;Francesco di Paola</b>, at Naples, in quasi-imitation of the
Pantheon at Rome, with wing-colonnades, and the <b>Superga</b>, at Turin
(1706, by <i>Ivara</i>); the façade of the San Carlo Theatre, at Naples,
and the Braccio Nuovo of the Vatican (1817, by <i>Stern</i>) are the
monuments which come the nearest to the spirit and style of the Roman
<span class = "pagenum">366</span>
<a name = "page366" id = "page366"> </a>
Revival. Yet in each of these there is a large element of originality
and freedom of treatment which renders doubtful their classification as
examples of that movement.</p>

<p>A reflection of the Munich school is seen in the modern public
buildings of Athens, designed in some cases by German architects, and in
others by native Greeks. The University, the Museum buildings, the
Academy of Art and Science, and other edifices exemplify fairly
successful efforts to adapt the severe details of classic Greek art to
modern windowed structures. They suffer somewhat from the too liberal
use of stucco in place of marble, and from the conscious affectation of
an extinct style. But they are for the most part pleasing and monumental
designs, adding greatly to the beauty of the modern city.</p>

FIG. 207.&mdash;ST. ISAAC’S CATHEDRAL, ST.&nbsp;PETERSBURG.</p>

<p>In Russia, during and after the reign of Peter the Great
(1689&ndash;1725), there appeared a curious mixture of styles.
A&nbsp;style analogous to the Jesuit in Italy and the Churrigueresque in
Spain was generally prevalent, but it was in many cases modified by
Muscovite traditions into nondescript forms like those of the
<b>Kremlin</b>, at Moscow, or the less extravagant Citadel Church and
Smolnoy Monastery at St. Petersburg. Along with this heavy and barbarous
style, which prevails generally in the numerous palaces of the capital,
finished in stucco with atrocious details, a&nbsp;more severe and
classical spirit is met with. The church of the <b>Greek Rite</b> at St.
Petersburg
<span class = "pagenum">367</span>
<a name = "page367" id = "page367"> </a>
combines a Roman domical interior with an exterior of the Greek Doric
order. The Church of <b>Our Lady of Kazan</b> has a semicircular
colonnade projecting from its transept, copying as nearly as may be the
colonnades in front of St. Peter’s. But the greatest classic monument in
Russia is the <b>Cathedral of St. Isaac</b> (Fig. 207), at St.
Petersburg, a&nbsp;vast rectangular edifice with four Roman Corinthian
pedimental colonnades projecting from its faces, and a dome with a
peristyle crowning the whole. Despite many defects of detail, and the
use of cast iron for the dome, which pretends to be of marble, this is
one of the most impressive churches of its size in Europe. Internally it
displays the costliest materials in extraordinary profusion, while
externally its noble colonnades go far to redeem its bare attic and the
material of its dome. The <b>Palace of the Grand Duke Michael</b>, which
reproduces, with improvements, Gabriel’s colonnades of the Garde Meuble
at Paris on its garden front, is a nobly planned and commendable design,
agreeably contrasting with the debased architecture of many of the
public buildings of the city. The Admiralty with its Doric pilasters,
and the <b>New Museum</b>, by von Klenze of Munich, in a skilfully
modified Greek style, with effective loggias, are the only other
monuments of the classic revival in Russia which can find mention in a
brief sketch like this. Both are notable and in many respects admirable
buildings, in part redeeming the vulgarity which is unfortunately so
prevalent in the architecture of St. Petersburg.</p>

<p><b>MODERN CONDITIONS.<!-- invisible . --></b> The nineteenth century
has been pre-eminently an age of industrial progress. Its most striking
advances have been along mechanical, scientific, and commercial lines.
As a result of this material progress the general conditions of mankind
in civilized countries have undoubtedly been greatly bettered. Popular
education and the printing-press have also raised the intellectual level
of society, making learning the privilege of even the poorest.
Intellectual, scientific, and commercial pursuits have thus largely
absorbed those energies which in other ages found exercise in the
creation of artistic forms and objects. The critical and sceptical
spirit, the spirit of utilitarianism and realism, has checked the free
and general development of the creative imagination, at least in the
plastic arts. While
<span class = "pagenum">369</span>
<a name = "page369" id = "page369"> </a>
in poetry and music there have been great and noble achievements, the
plastic arts, including architecture, have only of late years attained a
position at all worthy of the intellectual advancement of the times.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the artistic spirit has never been wholly crushed out by
the untoward pressure of realism and commercialism. Unfortunately it has
repeatedly been directed in wrong channels. Modern archæology and the
publication of the forms of historic art by books and photographs have
too exclusively fastened attention upon the details of extinct styles as
a source of inspiration in design. The whole range of historic art is
brought within our survey, and while this has on the one hand tended
toward the confusion and multiplication of styles in modern work, it has
on the other led to a slavish adherence to historic precedent or a
literal copying of historic forms. Modern architecture has thus
oscillated between the extremes of archæological servitude and of an
unreasoning eclecticism. In the hands of men of inferior training the
results have been deplorable travesties of all styles, or meaningless
aggregations of ill-assorted forms.</p>

<p>An important factor in this demoralization of architectural design
has been the development of new constructive methods, especially in the
use of iron and steel. It has been impossible for modern designers, in
their treatment of style, to keep pace with the rapid changes in the
structural use of metal in architecture. The roofs of vast span, largely
composed of glass, which modern methods of trussing have made possible
for railway stations, armories, and exhibition buildings; the immense
unencumbered spaces which may be covered by them; the introduction and
development, especially in the United States, of the post-and-girder
system of construction for high buildings, in which the external walls
are a mere screen or filling-in; these have revolutionized architecture
so rapidly and completely
<span class = "pagenum">370</span>
<a name = "page370" id = "page370"> </a>
that architects are still struggling and groping to find the solution of
many of the problems of style, scale, and composition which they have
brought forward.</p>

<p>Within the last thirty years, however, architecture has, despite
these new conditions, made notable advances. The artistic emulation of
repeated international exhibitions, the multiplication of museums and
schools of art, the general advance in intelligence and enlightenment,
have all contributed to this artistic progress. There appears to be more
of the artistic and intellectual quality in the average architecture of
the present time, on both sides of the Atlantic, than at any previous
period in this century. The futility of the archæological revival of
extinct styles is generally recognized. New conditions are gradually
procuring the solution of the very problems they raise. Historic
precedent sits more lightly on the architect than formerly, and the
essential unity of principle underlying all good design is coming to be
better understood.<a class = "tag" name = "tag26" id = "tag26" href =

<p><b>FRANCE.</b> It is in France, Germany (including Austria), and
England that the architectural progress of this period in Europe has
been most marked. We have already noticed the results of the classic
revivals in these three countries. Speaking broadly, it may be said that
in France the influence of the <i>École des Beaux-Arts</i>, while it has
tended to give greater unity and consistency to the national
architecture, and has exerted a powerful influence in behalf of
refinement of taste and correctness of style, has also stood in the way
of a free development of new ideas. French architecture has throughout
adhered to the principles of the Renaissance, though the style has
during this century been modified by various influences. The first of
these was the Néo-Grec movement, alluded to in the last chapter, which
broke the grip of Roman tradition in matters of detail and gave greater
elasticity to the national style. Next should be mentioned the Gothic
movement represented by Viollet-le-Duc,
<span class = "pagenum">371</span>
<a name = "page371" id = "page371"> </a>
Lassus, Ballu, and their followers. Beginning about 1845, it produced
comparatively few notable buildings, but gave a great impulse to the
study of mediæval archæology and the restoration of mediæval monuments.
The churches of Ste. Clothilde and of St. Jean de Belleville, at Paris,
and the reconstruction of the Château de Pierrefonds, were among its
direct results. Indirectly it led to a freer and more rational treatment
of constructive forms and materials than had prevailed with the academic
designers. The church of <b>St. Augustin</b>, by <i>Baltard</i>, at
Paris, illustrates this in its use of iron and brick for the dome and
vaulting, and the <b>College Chaptal</b>, by <i>E.&nbsp;Train</i>, in
its decorative treatment of brick and tile externally. The general
adoption of iron for roof-trusses and for the construction of markets
and similar buildings tended further in the same direction, the
<b>Halles Centrales</b> at Paris, by <i>Baltard</i>, being a notable
example.</p>

<p><b>THE SECOND EMPIRE.</b> The reign of Napoleon III. (1852&ndash;70)
was a period of exceptional activity, especially in Paris. The greatest
monument of his reign was the completion of the <b>Louvre</b> and
<b>Tuileries</b>, under <i>Visconti</i> and
<span class = "pagenum">372</span>
<a name = "page372" id = "page372"> </a>
<i>Lefuel</i>, including the remodelling of the pavilions de Flore and
de Marsan. The new portions constitute the most notable example of
modern French architecture, and the manner in which the two palaces were
united deserves high praise. In spite of certain defects, this work is
marked by a combination of dignity, richness, and refinement, such as
are rarely found in palace architecture (Figs. 208, 209). The <b>New
Opera</b> (1863&ndash;75), by <i>Garnier</i> (d.<!-- invisible .
-->&nbsp;1898), stands next to the Louvre in importance as a national
monument. It is by far the most sumptuous building for amusement in
existence, but in purity of detail and in the balance and restraint of
its design it is inferior to the work of Visconti and Lefuel (Fig. 210).
To this reign belong the Palais de l’Industrie, by <i>Viel</i>, built
for the exhibition of 1855, and several great railway stations (Gare du
Nord, by Hitorff, Gare de l’Est, Gare d’Orléans, etc.), in which the
modern French version of the Renaissance was applied with considerable
skill to buildings largely constructed of iron and glass. Town halls and
theatres were erected in great numbers, and in decorative works like
fountains and monuments the French were particularly successful. The
fountains of <b>St. Michel</b>, Cuvier, and Molière, at Paris, and of
<b>Longchamps</b>, at Marseilles (Fig. 211),
<span class = "pagenum">373</span>

illustrate the fertility of resource and elegance of detailed treatment
of the French in this department. Mention should also here be made of
the extensive enterprises carried out by Napoleon III., in rectifying
and embellishing the street-plan of Paris by new avenues and squares on
a vast scale, adding greatly to the monumental splendor of the city.</p>

<p><b>THE REPUBLIC.</b> Since the disasters of 1870 a number of
important structures have been erected, and French architecture has
shown a remarkable vitality and flexibility under new conditions. Its
productions have in general been marked by a refined taste and a
conspicuous absence of eccentricity and excess; but it has for the most
part trodden in well-worn paths. The most notable recent monuments are,
in church architecture, the <b>Sacré-Cœur</b>, at Montmartre, by
<i>Abadie</i>, a&nbsp;votive church inspired from the Franco-Byzantine
style of Aquitania; in civil architecture the new <b>Hôtel de Ville</b>,
at Paris, by <i>Ballu</i> and <i>Déperthes</i>, recalling the original
structure destroyed by the Commune, but in reality an original creation
of great merit; in scholastic
<span class = "pagenum">374</span>
<a name = "page374" id = "page374"> </a>
architecture the new École de Médecine, and the new <b>Sorbonne</b>, by
<i>Nénot</i>, and in other branches of the art the metal-and-glass
exhibition buildings of 1878, 1889, and 1900. In the last of these the
striving for originality and the effort to discard traditional forms
reached the extreme, although accompanied by much very clever detail and
a masterly use of color-decoration.<!-- invisible . --> To these should
be added many noteworthy theatres, town-halls, court-houses, and
<i>préfectures</i> in provincial cities, and commemorative columns and
monuments almost without number. In street architecture there is now
much more variety and originality than formerly, especially in private
houses, and the reaction against the orders and against traditional
methods of design has of late been growing stronger.

<p><b>GERMANY AND AUSTRIA.</b> German architecture has been more
affected during the past fifty years by the archæological spirit than
has the French. A&nbsp;pronounced mediæval revival partly accompanied,
partly followed the Greek revival in Germany, and produced a number of
churches and a few secular buildings in the basilican, Romanesque, and
Gothic styles.<!-- invisible . --> These are less interesting than those
in the Greek style, because mediæval forms are even more foreign to
modern needs than the classic, being compatible only with systems of
design and construction which are no longer practicable. At Munich the
Auekirche, by <i>Ohlmuller</i>, in an attenuated Gothic style; the
Byzantine Ludwigskirche, and <i>Ziebland’s</i> Basilica following Early
Christian models; the Basilica by <i>Hübsch<!-- invisible umlaut
--></i>, at Bulach, and the Votive Church at Vienna (1856) by
H.&nbsp;Von Ferstel (1828&ndash;1883) are notable neo-mediæval
monuments. The last-named church may be classed with Ste. Clothilde at
Paris (see <a href = "#page371">p.&nbsp;371</a>), and St. Patrick’s
Cathedral at New York, all three being of approximately the same size
and general style, recalling St. Ouen at Rouen. They are correct and
elaborate, but more or less cold and artificial.</p>

<p>More successful are many of the German theatres and concert halls, in
which Renaissance and classic forms have been freely used. In several of
these the attempt has been
<span class = "pagenum">376</span>
<a name = "page376" id = "page376"> </a>
made to express by the external form the curvilinear plan of the
auditorium, as in the <b>Dresden Theatre</b>, by <i>Semper</i> (1841;
Fig. 213), the theatre at Carlsruhe, by Hübsch, and the double
winter-summer <b>Victoria Theatre</b>, at Berlin, by <i>Titz</i>. But
the practical and æsthetic difficulties involved in this treatment have
caused its general abandonment. The <b>Opera House</b> at Vienna, by
<i>Siccardsburg</i> and <i>Van der Null</i> (1861&ndash;69), is
rectangular in its masses, and but for a certain triviality of detail
would rank among the most successful buildings of its kind. The new
<b>Burgtheater</b> in the same city is a more elaborately ornate
structure in Renaissance style, somewhat florid and overdone.</p>

<p>Modern German architecture is at its best in academic and residential
buildings. The <b><ins class = "correction" title = "text has ‘Bauschüle’ with umlaut">Bauschule</ins></b>, at Berlin, by Schinkel, in
which brick is used in a rational and dignified design without the
orders; the Polytechnic School, at Zürich, by Semper; university
buildings, and especially buildings for technical instruction, at
Carlsruhe, Stuttgart, Strasburg, Vienna, and other cities, show a
monumental
<span class = "pagenum">377</span>
<a name = "page377" id = "page377"> </a>
treatment of the exterior and of the general distribution, combined with
a careful study of practical requirements. In administrative buildings
the Germans have hardly been as successful; and the new <b>Parliament
House</b>, at Berlin, by <i>Wallot</i>, in spite of its splendor and
costliness, is heavy and unsatisfactory in detail. The larger cities,
especially Berlin, contain many excellent examples of house
architecture, mostly in the Renaissance style, sufficiently monumental
in design, though usually, like most German work, inclined to heaviness
of detail. The too free use of stucco in imitation of stone is also open
to criticism.</p>

<p><b>VIENNA.</b> During the last thirty years Vienna has undergone a
transformation which has made it the rival of Paris as a stately
capital. The remodelling of the central portion, the creation of a
series of magnificent boulevards and
<span class = "pagenum">378</span>
<a name = "page378" id = "page378"> </a>
squares, and the grouping of the chief state and municipal buildings
about these upon a monumental scheme of arrangement, have given the city
an unusual aspect of splendor. Among the most important monuments in
this group are the <b>Parliament House</b>, by Hansen (see <a href =
"#page360">p.&nbsp;360</a>), and the <b>Town Hall</b>, by
<i>Schmidt</i>. This latter is a Neo-Gothic edifice of great size and
pretentiousness, but strangely thin and meagre in detail, and quite out
of harmony with its surroundings. The university and museums are massive
piles in Renaissance style; and it is the Renaissance rather than the
classic or Gothic revival which prevails throughout the new city. The
great blocks of residences and apartments (Fig. 214) which line its
streets are highly ornate in their architecture, but for the most part
done in stucco, which fails after all to give the aspect of solidity and
durability which it seeks to counterfeit.</p>

<p>The city of <b>Buda-Pesth</b> has also in recent years undergone a
phenomenal transformation of a similar nature to that effected in
Vienna, but it possesses fewer monuments of conspicuous architectural
interest. The <b>Synagogue</b> is the most noted of these, a&nbsp;rich
and pleasing edifice of brick in a modified Hispano-Moresque style.</p>

<p><b>GREAT BRITAIN.</b> During the closing years of the Anglo-Greek
style a coterie of enthusiastic students of British mediæval
monuments&mdash;archæologists rather than architects&mdash;initiated a
movement for the revival of the national Gothic architecture. The first
fruits of this movement, led by Pugin, Brandon, Rickman, and others
(about 1830&ndash;40), were seen in countless pseudo-Gothic structures
in which the pointed arches, buttresses, and clustered shafts of
mediæval architecture were imitated or parodied according to the
designer’s ability, with frequent misapprehension of their proper use or
significance. This unintelligent misapplication of Gothic forms was,
however, confined to the earlier stages of the movement. With increasing
light and experience
<span class = "pagenum">379</span>
<a name = "page379" id = "page379"> </a>
came a more correct and consistent use of the mediæval styles, dominated
by the same spirit of archæological correctness which had produced the
<i>classicismo</i> of the Late Renaissance in Italy. This spirit,
stimulated by extensive enterprises in the restoration of the great
mediæval monuments of the United Kingdom, was fatal to any free and
original development of the style along new lines. But it rescued church
architecture from the utter meanness and debasement into which it had
fallen, and established a standard of taste which reacted on all other
branches of design.</p>

<p><b>THE VICTORIAN GOTHIC.</b> Between 1850 and 1870 the striving after
archæological correctness gave place to the more rational effort to
adapt Gothic principles to modern
<span class = "pagenum">380</span>
<a name = "page380" id = "page380"> </a>
requirements, instead of merely copying extinct styles. This effort,
prosecuted by a number of architects of great intelligence, culture, and
earnestness (Sir Gilbert Scott, George Edmund Street, William Burges,
and others), resulted in a number of extremely interesting buildings.
Chief among these in size and cost stand the <b>Parliament Houses</b> at
Westminster, by <i>Sir Charles Barry</i> (begun 1839), in the
Perpendicular style. This immense structure (Fig. 215), imposing in its
simple masses and refined in its carefully studied detail, is the most
successful monument of the Victorian Gothic style. It suffers, however,
from the want of proper relation of scale between its decorative
elements and the vast proportions of the edifice, which belittle its
component elements. It cannot, on the whole, be claimed as a successful
vindication of the claims of the promoters of the style as to the
adaptability of Gothic forms to structures planned and built after the
modern fashion. The <b>Assize Courts</b> at Manchester (Fig. 216), the
<b>New Museum</b> at Oxford, the gorgeous <b>Albert Memorial</b> at
London, by <i>Scott</i>, and the <b>New Law Courts</b> at London, by
<i>Street</i>, are
<span class = "pagenum">381</span>
<a name = "page381" id = "page381"> </a>
all conspicuous illustrations of the same truth. They are conscientious,
carefully studied designs in good taste, and yet wholly unsuited in
style to their purpose. They are like labored and scholarly verse in a
foreign tongue, correct in form and language, but lacking the
naturalness and charm of true and unfettered inspiration. A&nbsp;later
essay of the same sort in a slightly different field is the <b>Natural
History Museum</b> at South Kensington, by <i>Waterhouse</i> (1879), an
imposing building in a modified Romanesque style (Fig. 217).</p>

FIG. 217.&mdash;NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM, LONDON.</p>


<p><b>OTHER WORKS.</b> The Victorian Gothic style responded to no deep
and general movement of the popular taste, and, like the Anglo-Greek
style, was doomed to failure from the inherent incongruity between
modern needs and mediæval forms. Within the last twenty years there has
been a quite general return to Renaissance principles, and the result is
seen in a large number of town-halls, exchanges, museums, and colleges,
in which Renaissance forms, with and without the orders, have been
treated with increasing freedom and skilful
<span class = "pagenum">382</span>
<a name = "page382" id = "page382"> </a>
adaptation to the materials and special requirements of each case. The
Albert Memorial Hall (1863, by General Scott) may be taken as an early
instance of this movement, and the <b>Imperial Institute</b> (Colonial
offices), by Collcutt, and Oxford Town Hall, by Aston Webb, as among its
latest manifestations. In domestic architecture the so-called Queen Anne
style has been much in vogue, as practised by Norman Shaw, Ernest
George, and others. It is really a modern style, originating in the
imitation of the modified Palladian style as used in the brick
architecture of Queen Anne’s time, but freely and often artistically
altered to meet modern tastes and needs.</p>

<p>In its emancipation from the mistaken principles of archæological
revivals, and in its evidences of improved taste and awakened
originality, contemporary British architecture shows promise of good
things to come. It is still inferior to the French in the monumental
quality, in technical resource and refinement of decorative detail.</p>


<p><b>ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE.</b> In other European countries recent
architecture shows in general increasing freedom and improved good
taste, but both its opportunities and its performance have been nowhere
else as conspicuous as in France, Germany, and England. The costly
Bourse and the vast but overloaded Palais de Justice at Brussels, by
<i>Polaert</i>, are neither of them conspicuous for refined and
cultivated taste. A&nbsp;few buildings of note in Switzerland, Russia,
and Greece might find mention in a more extended review of architecture,
but cannot here even be enumerated. In Italy, especially at Rome, Milan,
Naples, and Turin, there has been a great activity in building since
1870, but with the exception of the <b>Monument to Victor Emmanuel</b>
and the National Museum at Rome, monumental arcades and passages at
Milan and Naples, and <i>Campi Santi</i> or monumental cemeteries at
Bologna, Genoa, and one or two other places, there has been almost
nothing of real importance built in Italy of late years.<!-- invisible .

<p><b>GENERAL REMARKS.</b> The colonial architecture of modern times
presents a peculiar phenomenon. The colonizing nation, carrying into its
new <i>habitat</i> the tastes and practices of a long-established
civilization, modifies these only with the utmost reluctance, under the
absolute compulsion of new conditions. When the new home is virgin soil,
destitute of cultivation, government, or civilized inhabitants, the
accompaniments and activities of civilization introduced by the
colonists manifest themselves at first in curious contrast to the
primitive surroundings. The struggle between organized life and chaos,
the laborious subjugation of nature to the requirements of our complex
modern life, for a considerable period absorb the energies of the
colonists. The amenities of culture, the higher intellectual life, the
refinements of art can, during this period, receive little
<span class = "pagenum">384</span>
<a name = "page384" id = "page384"> </a>
attention. Meanwhile a new national character is being formed; the
people are undergoing the moral training upon which their subsequent
achievements must depend. With the conquest of brute nature, however,
and the gradual emergence of a more cultivated class, with the growth of
commerce and wealth and the consequent increase of leisure, the
humanities find more place in the colonial life. The fine arts appear in
scattered centres determined by peculiarly favorable conditions. For a
long time they retain the impress, and seek to reproduce the forms, of
the art of the mother country. But new conditions impose a new
development. Maturing commerce with other lands brings in foreign
influences, to which the still unformed colonial art is peculiarly
susceptible. Only with political and commercial independence, fully
developed internal resources, and a high national culture do the arts
finally attain, as it were, their majority, and enter upon a truly
national growth.</p>

<p>These facts are abundantly illustrated by the architectural history
of the United States. The only one among the British colonies to attain
political independence, it is the only one among them whose architecture
has as yet entered upon an independent course of development, and this
only within the last twenty-five or thirty years. Nor has even this
development produced as yet a distinctive local style. It has, however,
originated new constructive methods, new types of buildings, and a
distinctively American treatment of the composition and the masses; the
decorative details being still, for the most part, derived from historic
precedents. The architecture of the other British colonies has retained
its provincial character, though producing from time to time individual
works of merit. In South America and Mexico the only buildings of
importance are Spanish, French, or German in style, according to the
nationality of the architects employed. The following
<span class = "pagenum">385</span>
<a name = "page385" id = "page385"> </a>
sketch of American architecture refers, therefore, exclusively to its
development in the United States.</p>


<p><b>FORMATIVE PERIOD.</b> Buildings in stone were not undertaken by
the early English colonists. The more important structures in the
Southern and Dutch colonies were of brick imported from Europe. Wood
was, however, the material most commonly employed, especially in New
England, and its use determined in large measure the form and style of
the colonial architecture. There was little or no striving for
architectural elegance until well into the eighteenth century, when
Wren’s influence asserted itself in a modest way in the Middle and
Southern colonies. The very simple and unpretentious town-hall at
Williamsburg, Va., and St. Michael’s, Charleston, are attributed to him;
but the most that can be said for these, as for the brick churches and
manors of Virginia previous to 1725, is that they are simple in design
and pleasing in proportion, without special architectural elegance. The
same is true of the wooden houses and churches of New England of the
period, except that they are even simpler in design.</p>

FIG. 218.&mdash;CHRIST CHURCH, PHILADELPHIA.<!-- invisible all . --></p>

<p>From 1725 to 1775 increased population and wealth along the coast
brought about a great advance in architecture, especially in churches
and in the dwellings of the wealthy. During this period was developed
the <i>Colonial style</i>, based on that of the reigns of Anne and the
first two Georges in England, and in church architecture on the models
set by Wren and Gibbs. All the details were, however, freely modified by
the general employment of wood. The scarcity of architects trained in
Old World traditions contributed to this departure from classic
precision of form. The style, especially in interior design, reflected
the cultured taste of the colonial aristocracy in its refined treatment
of the woodwork. But there was little or no architecture of a truly
monumental character. Edifices of stone were singularly few, and
administrative buildings were small and modest,
<span class = "pagenum">386</span>
<a name = "page386" id = "page386"> </a>
owing to insufficient grants from the Crown, as well as to the poverty
of the colonies.</p>

<p>The churches of this period include a number of interesting designs,
especially pleasing in the forms of their steeples. The “<b>Old
South</b>” at Boston (now a museum), Trinity at Newport, and <b>St.
Paul’s</b> at New York&mdash;one of the few built of stone
(1764)&mdash;are good examples of the style. <b>Christ Church</b> at
Philadelphia (1727&ndash;35, by Dr. Kearsley) is another example,
historically as well as architecturally interesting (Fig. 218); and
there are scores of other churches almost equally noteworthy, scattered
through New England, Maryland, Virginia, and the Middle States.</p>


<p><b>DWELLINGS.</b> These reflect better than the churches the varying
tastes of the different colonies. Maryland and Virginia abound in fine
brick manor-houses, set amid extensive grounds walled in and entered
through iron gates of artistic design. The interior finish of these
houses was often elaborate in conception and admirably executed.
Westover (1737), Carter’s Grove (1737) in Virginia, and the Harwood and
Hammond Houses at Annapolis, Md. (1770), are examples. The majority of
the New England houses were of wood, more compact in plan, more varied
and picturesque in design than those of the South, but wanting somewhat
of their stateliness.
<span class = "pagenum">387</span>
<a name = "page387" id = "page387"> </a>
The interior finish of wainscot, cornices, stairs, and mantelpieces
shows, however, the same general style, in a skilful and artistic
adaptation of classic forms to the slender proportions of wood
construction. Externally the orders appear in porches and in colossal
pilasters, with well designed entablatures, and windows of Italian
model. The influence of the <ins class = "correction" title =
"consistent error for ‘Adam’">Adams</ins> and Sheraton furniture is
doubtless to be seen in these quaint and often charming versions of
classic motives. The Hancock House, Boston (of stone, demolished); the
Sherburne House, Portsmouth (1730); Craigie House, Cambridge (1757, Fig.
219); and Rumford House, North Woburn (Mass.), are typical examples.</p>

<p>In the Middle States architectural activity was chiefly centred in
Philadelphia and New York, and one or two other towns, where a number of
manor-houses, still
<span class = "pagenum">388</span>
<a name = "page388" id = "page388"> </a>
extant, attest the wealth and taste of the time. It is noticeable that
the veranda or piazza was confined to the Southern States, but that the
climate seems to have had little influence on the forms of roofs. These
were gambrelled, hipped, gabled, or flat, alike in the North and South,
according to individual taste.</p>


<p><b>PUBLIC BUILDINGS.</b> Of public and monumental architecture this
period has little to show. Large cities did not exist; New York, Boston,
and Philadelphia were hardly more than overgrown villages. The public
buildings&mdash;court-houses and town-halls&mdash;were modest and
inexpensive structures. The Old State House and Faneuil Hall at Boston,
the Town Hall at Newport (R.I.), and Independence Hall at Philadelphia,
the best known of those now extant, are not striking architecturally.
Monumental design was beyond the opportunities and means of the
colonies. It was in their churches, all of moderate size, and in their
dwellings that the colonial builders achieved their greatest successes;
and these works are quaint, charming, and refined, rather than
impressive or imposing.</p>

<p>To the latter part of the colonial period belong a number of
interesting buildings which remain as monuments of Spanish rule in
California, Florida, and the Southwest. The old Fort S.&nbsp;Marco, now
Fort Marion (1656&ndash;1756), and the Catholic cathedral (1793; after
the fire of 1887 rebuilt in its original form with the original façade
uninjured), both at St. Augustine, Fla.; the picturesque buildings of
the California missions (mainly 1769&ndash;1800), the majority of them
now in ruins; scattered Spanish churches in California, Arizona, and New
Mexico, and a few unimportant secular buildings, display among their
modern and American settings a picturesque and interesting Spanish
aspect and character, though from the point of view of architectural
detail they represent merely a crude phase of the Churrigueresque
style.</p>

FIG. 220.&mdash;NATIONAL CAPITOL, WASHINGTON.</p>

<p><b>EARLY REPUBLICAN PERIOD.</b> Between the Revolution and the War of
1812, under the new conditions of independence and self-government,
architecture took on a more monumental character. Buildings for the
State and National administrations were erected with the rapidly
increasing resources of the country. Stone was more generally used;
colonnades, domes, and cupolas or bell-towers, were adopted as
indispensable features of civic architecture. In church-building the
Wren-Gibbs type continued to prevail, but with greater correctness of
classic forms. The gambrel roof tended to disappear from the houses of
this period, and there was some decline in the refinement and delicacy
of the details of architecture. The influence of the Louis XVI. style is
traceable in many cases, as in the New York City Hall (1803&ndash;12, by
<i>McComb</i> and <i>Mangin</i>), one of the very best designs of the
time, and in the delicate stucco-work and interior finish of many
houses, The original <b>Capitol</b> at Washington&mdash;the central
portion of the present edifice&mdash;by <i>Thornton</i>, <i>Hallet</i>,
and <i>B.&nbsp;H. Latrobe</i> (1793&ndash;1830; Fig. 220),
<span class = "pagenum">390</span>
<a name = "page390" id = "page390"> </a>
the <b>State House</b> at Boston (1795, by <i>Bulfinch</i>), and the
University of Virginia, at Charlotteville, by <i>Thomas Jefferson</i>
(1817; recently destroyed in part by fire), are the most interesting
examples of the classic tendencies of this period. Their freedom from
the rococo vulgarities generally prevalent at the time in Europe is
noticeable.</p>

FIG. 221.&mdash;CUSTOM HOUSE, NEW YORK.</p>

<p><b>THE CLASSIC REVIVAL.</b> The influence of the classic revivals of
Europe began to appear before the close of this period, and reached its
culmination about 1830&ndash;40. It left its impress most strongly on
our Federal architecture, although it invaded domestic architecture,
producing countless imitations, in brick and wooden houses, of Grecian
colonnades and porticos. One of its first-fruits was the White House, or
Executive Mansion, at Washington, by <i>Hoban</i> (1792), recalling the
large English country houses of the time. The <b>Treasury</b> and
<b>Patent Office</b> buildings at Washington, the Philadelphia Mint, the
<b>Sub-treasury</b> and <b>Custom House</b> at New York (the latter
erected originally for a bank; Fig. 221), and the <b>Boston Custom
House</b> are among the important Federal buildings of this period.
Several State capitols were also erected under the same influence; and
the Marine Exchange and <b>Girard College</b> at Philadelphia should
also be mentioned
<span class = "pagenum">391</span>
<a name = "page391" id = "page391"> </a>
as conspicuous examples of the pseudo-Greek style. The last-named
building is a Corinthian dormitory, its tiers of small windows
contrasting strangely with its white marble columns. These classic
buildings were solidly and carefully constructed, but lacked the grace,
cheerfulness, and appropriateness of earlier buildings. The Capitol at
Washington was during this period greatly enlarged by terminal wings
with fine Corinthian porticos, of Roman rather than Greek design. The
<b>Dome</b>, by <i>Walters</i>, was not added until 1858&ndash;73; it is
a successful and harmonious composition, nobly completing the building.
Unfortunately, it is an afterthought, built of iron painted to simulate
marble, the substructure being inadequate to support a dome of masonry.
The Italian or Roman style which it exemplified, in time superseded the
less tractable Greek style.</p>


<p><b>THE WAR PERIOD.</b> The period from 1850 to 1876 was one of
intense political activity and rapid industrial progress. The former
culminated in the terrible upheaval of the civil war; the latter in the
completion of the Pacific Railroad (1869) and a remarkable development
of the mining resources and manufactures of the country. It was a period
of feverish commercial activity, but of artistic stagnation, and
witnessed the erection of but few buildings of architectural importance.
A&nbsp;number of State capitols, city halls and churches, of
considerable size and cost but of inferior design, attest the decline of
public taste and architectural skill during these years. The huge
Municipal Building at Philadelphia and the still unfinished Capitol at
Albany are full of errors of planning and detail which twenty-five years
of elaboration have failed to correct. Next to the dome of the Capitol
at Washington, completed during this period, of which it is the most
signal architectural achievement, its most notable monument was the
<b>St. Patrick’s Cathedral</b> at New York, by <i>Renwick</i>;
a&nbsp;Gothic church which, if somewhat cold and mechanical in detail,
is
<span class = "pagenum">392</span>
<a name = "page392" id = "page392"> </a>
a&nbsp;stately and well-considered design. Its west front and spires
(completed 1886) are particularly successful. Trinity Church (1843, by
<i>Upjohn</i>) and Grace Church (1840, by Renwick), though of earlier
date, should be classed with this cathedral as worthy examples of modern
Gothic design. Indeed, the churches designed in this style by a few
thoroughly trained architects during this period are the most creditable
and worthy among its lesser productions. In general an undiscriminating
eclecticism of style prevailed, unregulated by sober taste or technical
training. The Federal buildings by <i>Mullett</i> were monuments of
perverted design in a heavy and inartistic rendering of French
Renaissance motives. The New York Post Office and the State, Army and
Navy Department building at Washington are examples of this style.</p>

<p><b>THE ARTISTIC AWAKENING.</b> Between 1870 and 1880 a remarkable
series of events exercised a powerful influence on the artistic life of
the United States. Two terrible conflagrations in Chicago (1871) and
Boston (1872) gave unexampled opportunities for architectural
improvement and greatly stimulated the public interest in the art. The
feverish and abnormal industrial activity which followed the war and the
rapid growth of the parvenu spirit were checked by the disastrous
“panic” of 1873. With the completion of the Pacific railways and the
settlement of new communities in the West, industrial prosperity, when
it returned, was established on a firmer basis. An extraordinary
expansion of travel to Europe began to disseminate the seeds of artistic
culture throughout the country. The successful establishment of schools
of architecture in Boston (1866) and other cities, and the opening or
enlargement of art museums in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore,
Detroit, Milwaukee, and elsewhere, stimulated the artistic awakening
which now manifested itself. In architecture the personal influence of
two men, trained in the Paris École des Beaux-Arts,<!-- invisible hyphen
-->
<span class = "pagenum">393</span>
<a name = "page393" id = "page393"> </a>
was especially felt&mdash;of <i>R.&nbsp;M. Hunt</i> (1827&ndash;95)
through his words and deeds quite as much as through his works; and of
<i>H.&nbsp;H. Richardson</i> (1828&ndash;86) predominantly through his
works. These two men, with others of less fame but of high ideals and
thorough culture, did much to elevate architecture as an art in the
public esteem. To all these influences new force was added by the
Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia (1876). Here for the first time
the American people were brought into contact, in their own land, with
the products of European and Oriental art. It was to them an artistic
revelation, whose results were prompt and far-reaching. Beginning first
in the domain of industrial and decorative art, its stimulating
influence rapidly extended to painting and architecture, and with
permanent consequences. American students began to throng the centres of
Old World art, while the setting of higher standards of artistic
excellence at home, and the development of important art-industries,
were other fruits of this artistic awakening. The recent Columbian
Exhibition at Chicago (1893), its latest and most important
manifestation, has added a new impulse to the movement, especially in
architecture.</p>

<p><b>STYLE IN RECENT ARCHITECTURE.</b> The rapid increase in the number
of American architects trained in Paris or under the indirect influence
of the École des Beaux-Arts has been an important factor in recent
architectural progress. Yet it has by no means imposed the French
academic formulæ upon American architecture. The conditions, materials,
and constructive processes here prevailing, and above all the
eclecticism of the public taste, have prevented this. The French
influence is perceived rather in a growing appreciation of monumental
design in the planning, composition, and setting of buildings, than in
any direct imitation of French models. The Gothic revival which
prevailed more or less widely from 1840 to 1875, as already noticed, and
of which the <b>State Capitol</b> at Hartford
<span class = "pagenum">394</span>
<a name = "page394" id = "page394"> </a>
(Conn.; 1875&ndash;78), and the <b>Fine Arts Museum</b> at Boston, were
among the last important products, was generally confined to church
architecture, for which Gothic forms are still largely employed, as in
the Protestant <b>Cathedral</b> of <b>All Saints</b> now building at
Albany (N.Y.), by an English architect. For the most part the works of
the last twenty years show a more or less judicious eclecticism, the
choice of style being determined partly by the person and training of
the designer, partly by the nature of the building. The powerfully
conceived works of Richardson, in a free version of the French
Romanesque, for a time exercised a wide influence, especially among the
younger architects. <b>Trinity Church</b>, Boston (<a href =
"#fig222">Fig. 222</a>), his earliest important work; many public
libraries and business buildings, and finally the impressive <b>County
Buildings</b> at Pittsburgh (Pa.), all
<span class = "pagenum">395</span>
<a name = "page395" id = "page395"> </a>
treated in this style, are admirable rather for the strong individuality
of their designer, displayed in their vigorous composition, than on
account of the historic style he employed (Fig. 223). Yet it appeared in
his hands so flexible and effective that it was widely imitated. But if
easy to use, it is most difficult to use well; its forms are too massive
for ordinary purposes, and in the hands of inferior designers it was so
often travestied that it has now lost its wide popularity. While a
number of able architects have continued to use it effectively in
ecclesiastical, civic, and even commercial architecture, it is being
generally superseded by various forms of the Renaissance. Here also a
wide eclecticism prevails, the works of the same architect often varying
from the gayest Francis&nbsp;I. designs in domestic architecture, or
free adaptations of Quattrocento details for theatres and street
architecture, to the most formal classicism in colossal
exhibition-buildings, museums, libraries, and the like. Meanwhile there
are many more or less successful ventures in other historic
<span class = "pagenum">396</span>
<a name = "page396" id = "page396"> </a>
styles applied to public and private edifices. Underlying this apparent
confusion, almost anarchy in the use of historic styles, the careful
observer may detect certain tendencies crystallizing into definite form.
New materials and methods of construction, increased attention to
detail, a&nbsp;growing sense of monumental requirements, even the
development of the elevator as a substitute for the grand staircase, are
leaving their mark on the planning, the proportions, and the artistic
composition of American buildings, irrespective of the styles used. The
art is with us in a state of transition, and open to criticism in many
respects; but it appears to be full of life and promise for the
future.</p>

FIG. 224.&mdash;“TIMES” BUILDING, NEW YORK.</p>

<p><b>COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS.</b> This class of edifices has in our great
cities developed wholly new types, which have taken shape under four
imperative influences. These are the demand for fire-proof construction,
the demand for well-lighted offices, the introduction of elevators, and
the concentration of business into limited areas, within which land has
become inordinately costly. These causes have led to the erection of
buildings of excessive height (Fig. 224); the more recent among them
constructed with a framework of iron or steel columns and beams, the
visible walls being a mere filling-in. To render a building of twenty
stories attractive to the eye, especially when built on an irregular
site, is a difficult problem, of which a wholly satisfactory solution
has yet to be found. There have been, however, some notable achievements
in this line, in most of which the principle has been clearly recognized
that a lofty building should have a well-marked
<span class = "pagenum">397</span>
<a name = "page397" id = "page397"> </a>
basement or pedestal and a somewhat ornate crowning portion or capital,
the intervening stories serving as a die or shaft and being treated with
comparative simplicity. The difficulties of scale and of handling one
hundred and fifty to three hundred windows of uniform style have been
surmounted with conspicuous skill (<b>American Surety Building</b> and
Broadway Chambers, New York; Ames Building, Boston; Carnegie Building,
Pittsburgh; Union Trust, St. Louis). In some cases, especially in
Chicago and the Middle West, the metallic framework is suggested by
slender piers between the windows, rising uninterrupted from the
basement to the top story. In others, especially in New York and the
East, the walls are treated as in ordinary masonry buildings. The
Chicago school is marked by a more utilitarian and unconventional
treatment, with results which are often extremely bold and effective,
but rarely as pleasing to the eye as those attained by the more
conservative Eastern school. In the details of American office-buildings
every variety of style is to be met with; but the Romanesque and the
Renaissance, freely modified, predominate. The tendency towards two or
three well-marked types in the external composition of these buildings,
as above suggested, promises, however, the evolution of a style in which
the historic origin of the details will be a secondary matter. Certain
Chicago architects have developed an original treatment of architectural
forms by exaggerating some of the structural lines, by suppressing the
mouldings and more familiar historic forms, and by the free use of flat
surface ornament. The Schiller, Auditorium, and Fisher Buildings, all at
Chicago, Guaranty Building, Buffalo, and Majestic Building, Detroit, are
examples of this personal style, which illustrates the untrammelled
freedom of the art in a land without traditions.<a class = "tag" name =

FIG. 225.&mdash;COUNTRY HOUSE, MASSACHUSETTS.</p>

<p><b>DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE.</b> It is in this field that the most
characteristic and original phases of American architecture
<span class = "pagenum">398</span>
<a name = "page398" id = "page398"> </a>
are to be met with, particularly in rural and suburban residences. In
these the peculiar requirements of our varying climates and of American
domestic life have been studied and in large measure met with great
frankness and artistic appreciation. The broad staircase-hall, serving
often as a sort of family sitting-room, the piazza, and a picturesque
massing of steep roofs, have been the controlling factors in the
evolution of two or three general types which appear in infinite
variations. The material most used is wood, but this has had less
influence in the determination of form than might have been expected.
The artlessness of the planning, which is arranged to afford the maximum
of convenience rather than to conform to any traditional type, has been
the element of greatest artistic success. It has resulted in exteriors
which are the natural outgrowth of
<span class = "pagenum">399</span>
<a name = "page399" id = "page399"> </a>
the interior arrangements, frankly expressed, without affectation of
style (Fig. 225). The resulting picturesqueness has, however, in many
cases been treated as an end instead of an incidental result, and the
affectation of picturesqueness has in such designs become as detrimental
as any affectation of style. In the internal treatment of American
houses there has also been a notable artistic advance, harmony of color
and domestic comfort and luxury being sought after rather than
monumental effects. A&nbsp;number of large city and country houses
designed on a palatial scale have, however, given opportunity for a more
elaborate architecture; notably the Vanderbilt, Villard, and Huntington
residences at New York, the great country-seat of <b>Biltmore</b>, near
Asheville (N.C.), in the Francis&nbsp;I. style (by R.&nbsp;M. Hunt), and
many others.</p>


<p><b>OTHER BUILDINGS.</b> American architects have generally been less
successful in public, administrative, and ecclesiastical architecture
than in commercial and domestic work. The preference for small parish
churches, treated as audience-rooms rather than as places of worship,
has interfered with the development of noble types of church-buildings.
Yet there are signs of improvement; and the new <b>Cathedral</b> of
<b>St. John the Divine</b> at New York, in a modified Romanesque style,
promises to be a worthy and monumental building. In semi-public
architecture, such as hotels, theatres, clubs, and libraries, there are
many notable examples of successful design. The <b>Ponce de Leon
Hotel</b> at St. Augustine, a&nbsp;sumptuous and imposing pile in a free
version of the Spanish Plateresco; the Auditorium Theatre at Chicago,
the Madison Square Garden and the Casino at New York, may be cited as
excellent in general conception and well carried out in detail,
externally and internally. The Century and Metropolitan Clubs at New
York, the <b>Boston Public Library</b>, the Carnegie Library at
Pittsburgh, the <b>Congressional Library</b> at Washington, and the
recently
<span class = "pagenum">400</span>
<a name = "page400" id = "page400"> </a>
completed Minnesota <b>State Capitol</b> at St. Paul, exemplify in
varying degrees of excellence the increasing capacity of American
architects for monumental design. This was further shown in the
buildings of the <b>Columbian Exposition</b> at Chicago in 1893. These,
in spite of many faults of detail, constituted an aggregate of
architectural splendor such as had never before been seen or been
possible on this side the Atlantic. They further brought architecture
into closer union with the allied arts and formed an object lesson in
the value of appropriate landscape gardening as a setting to monumental
structures.</p>

<p>It should be said, in conclusion, that with the advances of recent
years in artistic design in the United States there has been at least as
great improvement in scientific construction. The sham and flimsiness of
the Civil War period are passing away, and solid and durable building is
becoming more general throughout the country, but especially in the
Northeast and in some of the great Western cities, notably in Chicago.
In this onward movement the Federal buildings&mdash;post-offices,
custom-houses, and other governmental edifices&mdash;have not, till
lately, taken high rank. Although solidly and carefully constructed,
those built during the period 1875&ndash;1895 were generally inferior to
the best work produced by private enterprise, or by State and municipal
governments. This was in large part due to enactments devolving upon the
supervising architect at Washington the planning of all Federal
buildings, as well as a burden of supervisory and clerical duties
incompatible with the highest artistic results. Since 1898, however,
a&nbsp;more enlightened policy has prevailed, and a number of notable
designs for Federal buildings have been secured by carefully-conducted
competitions.</p>

<p><b>INTRODUCTORY NOTE.</b> The architecture of the non-Moslem
countries and races of Asia has been reserved for this closing chapter,
in order not to interrupt the continuity of the history of European
styles, with which it has no affinity and scarcely even a point of
contact. Among them all, India alone has produced monuments of great
architectural importance. The buildings of China and Japan, although
interesting for their style, methods, and detail, and so deserving at
least of brief mention, are for the most part of moderate size and of
perishable materials. Outside of these three countries there is little
to interest the general student of architecture.</p>


<p><b>INDIA: PERIODS.</b> It is difficult to classify the non-Mohammedan
styles of India, owing to their frequently overlapping, both
geographically and artistically; while the lack of precise dates in
Indian literature makes the chronology of many of the monuments more or
less doubtful. The
<span class = "pagenum">402</span>
<a name = "page402" id = "page402"> </a>
divisions given below are a modification of those first established by
Fergusson, and are primarily based on the three great religions, with
geographical subdivisions, as follows:</p>

<p><span class = "smallroman">THE BUDDHIST STYLE</span>, from the reign
of Asoka, <i>cir.</i> 250 <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>, to the
7th century <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> Its monuments occupy
mainly a broad band running northeast and southwest, between the Indian
Desert and the Dekkan. Offshoots of the style are found as far north as
Gandhara, and as far south as Ceylon.</p>

<p><span class = "smallroman">THE JAINA STYLE</span>, akin to the
preceding if not derived from it, covering the same territory as well as
southern India; from 1000 <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> to the
present time.</p>

<p><span class = "smallroman">THE BRAHMAN</span> or <span class =
"smallroman">HINDU STYLES</span>, extending over the whole peninsula.
They are sub-divided geographically into the <span class =
"smallroman">NORTHERN BRAHMAN</span>, the <span class =
"smallroman">CHALUKYAN</span> in the Dekkan, and the <span class =
"smallroman">DRAVIDIAN</span> in the south; this last style being
coterminous with the populations speaking the Tamil and cognate
languages. The monuments of these styles are mainly subsequent to the
10th century, though a few date as far back as the 7th.</p>

<p>The great majority of Indian monuments are religious&mdash;temples,
shrines, and monasteries. Secular buildings do not appear until after
the Moslem conquests, and most of them are quite modern.</p>


<p><b>GENERAL CHARACTER.</b> All these styles possess certain traits in
common. While stone and brick are both used, sandstone predominating,
the details are in large measure derived from wooden prototypes.
Structural lines are not followed in the exterior treatment, purely
decorative considerations prevailing. Ornament is equally lavished on
all parts of the building, and is bewildering in its amount and
complexity. Realistic and grotesque sculpture is freely used, forming
multiplied horizontal bands of extraordinary richness and minuteness of
execution. Spacious and lofty
<span class = "pagenum">403</span>
<a name = "page403" id = "page403"> </a>
interiors are rarely attempted, but wonderful effects are produced by
seemingly endless repetition of columns in halls, and corridors, and by
external emphasis of important parts of the plan by lofty tower-like
piles of masonry.</p>

<p>The source of the various Indian styles, the origin of the forms
used, the history of their development, are all wrapped in obscurity.
All the monuments show a fully developed style and great command of
technical resources from the outset. When, where, and how these were
attained is as yet an unsolved mystery. In all its phases previous to
the Moslem conquest Indian architecture appears like an indigenous art,
borrowing little from foreign styles, and having no affinities with the
arts of Occidental nations.</p>


<p><b>BUDDHIST STYLE.</b> Although Buddhism originated in the sixth
century <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>, the earliest
architectural remains of the style date from its wide promulgation in
India under Asoka (272&ndash;236 <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span>). Buddhist monuments comprise three chief
classes of structures: the <i>stupas</i> or <i>topes</i>, which are
mounds more or less domical in shape, enclosing relic-shrines of Buddha,
or built to mark some sacred spot; <i>chaityas</i>, or temple halls, cut
in the rock; and <i>viharas</i>, or monasteries. The style of the detail
varies considerably in these three classes, but is in general simpler
and more massive than in the other styles of India.</p>


<p><b>TOPES.</b> These are found in groups, of which the most important
are at or near Bhilsa in central India, at Manikyala in the northwest,
at Amravati in the south, and in Ceylon at Ruanwalli and Tuparamaya. The
best known among them is the <b>Sanchi Tope</b>, near Bhilsa, 120 feet
in diameter and 56 feet high. It is surrounded by a richly carved stone
rail or fence, with gateways of elaborate workmanship, having three
sculptured lintels crossing the carved uprights. The tope at Manikyala
is larger, and dates from the 7th century. It is exceeded in size by
many in Ceylon, that at Abayagiri measuring 360 feet in
<span class = "pagenum">404</span>
<a name = "page404" id = "page404"> </a>
diameter. Few of the topes retain the <i>tee</i>, or model of a shrine,
which, like a lantern, once crowned each of them.</p>

<p>Besides the topes there are a few stupas of tower-like form, square
in plan, of which the most famous is that at <b>Buddh Gaya</b>, near the
sacred Bodhi tree, where Buddha attained divine light in 588&nbsp;<span
class = "smallroman">B.C.</span></p>


<p><b>CHAITYA HALLS.</b> The Buddhist speos-temples&mdash;so far as
known the only extant halls of worship of that religion, except one at
Sanchi&mdash;are mostly in the Bombay Presidency, at Ellora, Karli,
Ajunta, Nassick, and Bhaja. The earliest, that at Karli, dates from 78
<span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>, the latest (at Ellora),
<i>cir.</i> 600 <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> They consist
uniformly of a broad nave ending in an apse, and covered by a roof like
a barrel vault, and two narrow side aisles. In the apse is the
<i>dagoba</i> or relic-shrine, shaped like a miniature tope. The front
of the cave was originally adorned with an open-work screen or frame of
wood, while the face of the rock about the opening was carved into the
semblance of a sumptuous structural façade. Among the finest of these
caverns is that at <b>Karli</b>, whose massive columns and impressive
scale recall Egyptian models, though the resemblance is superficial and
has no historic significance. More suggestive is the affinity of many of
the columns which stand before these caves to Persian prototypes (see <a
href = "arch1.html#fig21">Fig.&nbsp;21</a>). It is not improbable that
both Persian and classic forms were introduced into India through the
Bactrian kingdom 250 years <span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>
Otherwise we must seek for the origin of nearly all Buddhist forms in a
pre-existing wooden architecture, now wholly perished, though its
traditions may survive in the wooden screens in the fronts of the caves.
While some of these caverns are extremely simple, as at Bhaja, others,
especially at <b>Nassick</b> and <b>Ajunta</b>, are of great splendor
and complexity.</p>


<p><b>VIHARAS.</b> Except at Gandhara in the Punjab, the structural
monasteries of the Buddhists were probably all of wood and have long ago
perished. The Gandhara monasteries
<span class = "pagenum">405</span>
<a name = "page405" id = "page405"> </a>
of Jamalgiri and Takht-i-Bahi present in plan three or four courts
surrounded by cells. The centre of one court is in both cases occupied
by a platform for an altar or shrine. Among the ruins there have been
found a number of capitals whose strong resemblance to the Corinthian
type is now generally attributed to Byzantine rather than Bactrian
influences. These viharas may therefore be assigned to the 6th or 7th
century&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span></p>

<p>The rock-cut viharas are found in the neighborhood of the chaityas
already described. Architecturally, they are far more elaborate than the
chaityas. Those at Salsette, Ajunta, and Bagh are particularly
interesting, with pillared halls or courts, cells, corridors, and
shrines. The hall of the <b>Great Vihara</b> at <b>Bagh</b> is 96 feet
square, with 36 columns. Adjoining it is the school-room, and the whole
is fronted by a sumptuous rock-cut colonnade 200 feet long. These caves
were mostly hewn between the 5th and 7th centuries, at which time
sculpture was more prevalent in Buddhist works than previously, and some
of them are richly adorned with figures.</p>


<p><b>JAINA STYLE.</b> The religion and the architecture of the Jainas
so closely resemble those of the Buddhists, that recent authorities are
disposed to treat the Jaina style as a mere variation or continuation of
the Buddhist. Chronologically they are separated by an interval of some
three centuries, <i>cir.</i> 650&ndash;950 <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span>, which have left us almost no monuments of
either style. The Jaina is moreover easily distinguished from the
Buddhist architecture by the great number and elaborateness of its
structural monuments. The multiplication of statues of Tirthankhar in
the cells about the temple courts, the exuberance of sculpture, the use
of domes built in horizontal courses, and the imitation in stone of
wooden braces or struts are among its distinguishing features.</p>

FIG. 226.&mdash;PORCH OF TEMPLE ON MOUNT ABU.</p>

<p><b>JAINA TEMPLES.</b> The earliest examples are on <b>Mount Abu</b>
<span class = "pagenum">406</span>
<a name = "page406" id = "page406"> </a>
in the Indian Desert. Built by Vimalah Sah in 1032, the chief of these
consists of a court measuring 140 × 90 feet, surrounded by cells and a
double colonnade. In the centre rises the shrine of the god, containing
his statue, and terminating in a lofty tower or <i>sikhra</i>. An
imposing columnar porch, cruciform in plan, precedes this cell (Fig.
226). The intersection of the arms is covered by a dome supported on
eight columns with stone brackets or struts. The dome and columns are
covered with profuse carving and sculptured figures, and the total
effect is one of remarkable dignity and splendor. The temple of
<b>Sadri</b> is much more extensive, twenty minor domes and one of
larger size forming cruciform porches on all four sides of the central
<i>sikhra</i>. The cells about the court are each covered by a small
<i>sikhra</i>, and these, with the twenty-one domes (four of which are
<span class = "pagenum">407</span>
<a name = "page407" id = "page407"> </a>
built in three stories), all grouped about the central tower and adorned
with an astonishing variety of detail, constitute a monument of the
first importance. It was built by Khumbo Rana, about 1450. At
<b>Girnar</b> are several 12th-century temples with enclosed instead of
open vestibules. One of these, that of <b>Neminatha</b>, retains intact
its court enclosure and cells, which in most other cases have perished.
The temple at <b>Somnath</b> resembles it, but is larger; the dome of
its porch, 33 feet in diameter, is the largest Jaina dome in India.
Other notable temples are at Gwalior, Khajuraho, and Parasnatha.</p>

<p>In all the Jaina temples the salient feature is the sikhra or
<i>vimana</i>. This is a tower of approximately square plan, tapering by
a graceful curve toward a peculiar terminal ornament shaped like a
flattened melon. Its whole surface is variegated by horizontal bands and
vertical breaks, covered with sculpture and carving. Next in importance
are the domes, built wholly in horizontal courses and resting on stone
lintels carried by bracketed columns. These same traits appear in
relatively modern examples, as at Delhi.</p>

FIG. 227.&mdash;TOWER OF VICTORY, CHITTORE.</p>

<p><b>TOWERS.</b> A similar predilection for minutely broken surfaces
marks the towers which sometimes adjoin the temples, as at Chittore
(tower of <b>Sri Allat</b>, 13th century), or were erected as trophies
of victory, like that of <b>Khumbo Rana</b> in
<span class = "pagenum">408</span>
<a name = "page408" id = "page408"> </a>
the same town (Fig. 227). The combination of horizontal and vertical
lines, the distribution of the openings, and the rich ornamentation of
these towers are very interesting, though lacking somewhat in structural
propriety of design.</p>


<p><b>HINDU STYLES: NORTHERN BRAHMAN.</b> The origin of this style is as
yet an unsolved problem. Its monuments were mainly built between 600 and
1200 <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>, the oldest being in Orissa,
at Bhuwanesevar, Kanaruk, and Puri. In northern India the temples are
about equally divided between the two forms of Brahmanism&mdash;the
worship of Vishnu or <i>Vaishnavism</i>, and that of Siva or
<i>Shaivism</i>&mdash;and do not differ materially in style. As in the
Jaina style, the <i>vimana</i> is their most striking feature, and this
is in most cases adorned with numerous reduced copies of its own form
grouped in successive stages against its sides and angles. This curious
system of design appears in nearly all the great temples, both of Vishnu
and Siva. The Jaina melon ornament is universal, surmounted generally by
an urn-shaped finial.</p>

<p>In plan the vimana shrine is preceded by two or three chambers,
square or polygonal, some with and some without columns. The foremost of
these is covered by a roof formed like a stepped pyramid set cornerwise.
The fine porch of the ruined temple at <b>Bindrabun</b> is cruciform in
plan and forms the chief part of the building, the shrine at the further
end being relatively small and its tower unfinished or ruined. In some
modern examples the antechamber is replaced by an open porch with a
Saracenic dome, as at Benares; in others the old type is completely
abandoned, as in the temple at <b>Kantonnuggur</b> (1704&ndash;22). This
is a square hall built of terra-cotta, with four three-arched porches
and nine towers, more Saracenic than Brahman in general aspect.</p>

<p>The <b>Kandarya Mahadeo</b>, at Khajuraho, is the most noted example
of the northern Brahman style, and one of the most splendid structures
extant. A&nbsp;strong and lofty basement
<span class = "pagenum">409</span>
<a name = "page409" id = "page409"> </a>
supports an extraordinary mass of roofs, covering the six open porches
and the antechamber and hypostyle hall, which precede the shrine, and
rising in successive pyramidal masses until the vimana is reached which
covers the shrine. This is 116 feet high, but seems much loftier, by
reason of the small scale of its constituent parts and the marvellously
minute decoration which covers the whole structure. The vigor of its
masses and the grand stairways which lead up to it give it a dignity
unusual for its size, 60 × 109 feet in plan (<i>cir.</i> 1000 <span
class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>).</p>

<p>At Puri, in Orissa, the <b>Temple</b> of <b>Jugganat</b>, with its
double enclosure and numerous subordinate shrines, the Teli-ka-Mandir at
Gwalior, and temples at <b>Udaipur</b> near Bhilsa, at <b>Mukteswara</b>
in Orissa, at Chittore, Benares, and Barolli, are important examples.
The few tombs erected subsequent to the Moslem conquest, combining Jaina
bracket columns with Saracenic domes, and picturesquely situated palaces
at Chittore (1450), Oudeypore (1580), and Gwalior, should also be
mentioned.</p>


<p><b>CHALUKYAN STYLE.</b> Throughout a central zone crossing the
peninsula from sea to sea about the Dekkan, and extending south to
Mysore on the west, the Brahmans developed a distinct style during the
later centuries of the Chalukyan dynasty. Its monuments are mainly
comprised between 1050 and the Mohammedan conquest in 1310. The most
notable examples of the style are found along the southwest coast, at
Hullabid, Baillur, and Somnathpur.</p>

FIG. 228.&mdash;TEMPLE AT HULLABÎD. DETAIL.</p>

<p><b>TEMPLES.</b> Chalukyan architecture is exclusively religious and
its temples are easily recognized. The plans comprise the same elements
as those of the Jainas, but the Chalukyan shrine is always star-shaped
externally in plan, and the vimana takes the form of a stepped pyramid
instead of a curved outline. The Jaina dome is, moreover, wholly
wanting. All the details are of extraordinary richness and beauty, and
the breaking up of the surfaces by rectangular
<span class = "pagenum">410</span>
<a name = "page410" id = "page410"> </a>
projections is skilfully managed so as to produce an effect of great
apparent size with very moderate dimensions. All the known examples
stand on raised platforms, adding materially to their dignity. Some are
double temples, as at Hullabid (Fig. 228); others are triple in plan.
A&nbsp;noticeable feature of the style is the deeply cut stratification
of the lower part of the temples, each band or stratum bearing a
distinct frieze of animals, figures or ornament, carved with masterly
skill. Pierced stone slabs filling the window openings are also not
uncommon.</p>

<p>The richest exemplars of the style are the temples at <b>Baillur</b>
and Somnathpur, and at Hullabîd the <b>Kait Iswara</b> and the
incomplete <b>Double Temple</b>. The Kurti Stambha, or gate at Worangul,
and the Great Temple at <b>Hamoncondah</b> should also be mentioned.</p>


<p><b>DRAVIDIAN STYLE.</b> The Brahman monuments of southern India
exhibit a style almost as strongly marked as the Chalukyan. This appears
less in their details than in their general plan and conception. The
Dravidian temples are not single structures, but aggregations of
buildings of varied size and form, covering extensive areas enclosed by
walls
<span class = "pagenum">411</span>
<a name = "page411" id = "page411"> </a>
and entered through gates made imposing by lofty pylons called
<i>gopuras</i>. As if to emphasize these superficial resemblances to
Egyptian models, the sanctuary is often low and insignificant. It is
preceded by much more imposing porches (<i>mantapas</i>) and hypostyle
halls or <i>choultries</i>, the latter being sometimes of extraordinary
extent, though seldom lofty. The choultrie, sometimes called the Hall of
1,000 Columns, is in some cases replaced by pillared corridors of great
length and splendor, as at <b>Ramisseram</b> and <b>Madura.</b> The
plans are in most cases wholly irregular, and the architecture, so far
from resembling the Egyptian in its scale and massiveness, is marked by
the utmost minuteness of ornament and tenuity of detail, suggesting wood
and stucco rather than stone. The <b>Great Hall</b> at Chillambaram is
but 10 to 12 feet high, and the corridors at Ramisseram, 700 feet long,
are but 30 feet high. The effect of <i>ensemble</i> of the Dravidian
temples is disappointing. They lack the emphasis of dominant masses and
the dignity of symmetrical and logical arrangement. The very loftiness
of the gopuras makes the buildings of the group within seem low by
contrast. In nearly every temple, however, some one feature attracts
merited admiration by its splendor, extent, or beauty. Such are the
<b>Choultrie</b>, built by Tirumalla Nayak at Madura (1623&ndash;45),
measuring 333 × 105 feet; the corridors already mentioned at Ramisseram
and in the <b>Great Temple</b> at Madura; the gopuras at <b>Tarputry</b>
and Vellore, and the <b>Mantapa</b> of <b>Parvati</b> at Chillambaram
(1595&ndash;1685). Very noticeable are the compound columns of this
style, consisting of square piers with slender shafts coupled to them
and supporting brackets, as at Chillambaram, Peroor, and Vellore; the
richly banded square piers, the grotesques of rampant horses and
monsters, and the endless labor bestowed upon minute carving and
ornament in superposed bands.</p>


<p><b>OTHER MONUMENTS.</b> Other important temples are at Tiruvalur,
Seringham, Tinevelly, and Conjeveram, all alike
<span class = "pagenum">412</span>
<a name = "page412" id = "page412"> </a>
in general scheme of design, with enclosures varying from 300 to 1,000
feet in length and width. At <b>Tanjore</b> is a magnificent temple with
two courts, in the larger of which stands a <i>pagoda</i> or shrine with
a pyramidal vimana, unusual in Dravidian temples, and beside it the
smaller <b>Shrine</b> of <b>Soubramanya</b> (Fig. 229), a&nbsp;structure
of unusual beauty of detail. In both, the vertical lower story with its
pilasters and windows is curiously suggestive of Renaissance design. The
pagoda dates from the 14th, the smaller temple from the 15th
century.</p>

FIG. 229.&mdash;SHRINE OF SOUBRAMANYA, TANJORE.</p>


<p><b>ROCK-CUT RATHS.</b> All the above temples were built subsequently
to the 12th century. The rock-cut shrines date in some cases as far back
as the 7th century; they are called <i>kylas</i> and <i>raths</i>, and
are not caves, but isolated edifices,
<span class = "pagenum">413</span>
<a name = "page413" id = "page413"> </a>
imitating structural designs, but hewn bodily from the rock. Those at
Mahavellipore are of diminutive size; but at <b>Purudkul</b> there is an
extensive temple with shrine, choultrie, and gopura surrounded by a
court enclosure measuring 250 × 150 feet (9th century). More famous
still is the elaborate <b>Kylas</b> at <b>Ellora</b>, of about the same
size as the above, but more complex and complete in its details.</p>


<p><b>PALACES.</b> At Madura, Tanjore, and Vijayanagar are Dravidian
palaces, built after the Mohammedan conquest and in a mixed style. The
domical octagonal throne-room and the <b>Great Hall</b> at Madura (17th
century), the most famous edifices of the kind, were evidently inspired
from Gothic models, but how this came about is not known. The Great Hall
with its pointed arched barrel vault of 67 feet span, its cusped arches,
round piers, vaulting shafts, and triforium, appears strangely foreign
to its surroundings.</p>


<p><b>CAMBODIA.</b> The subject of Indian architecture cannot be
dismissed without at least brief mention of the immense temple of
<b>Nakhon Wat</b> in Cambodia. This stupendous creation covers an area
of a full square mile, with its concentric courts, its encircling moat
or lake, its causeways, porches, and shrines, dominated by a central
structure 200 feet square with nine pagoda-like towers. The corridors
around the inner court have square piers of almost classic Roman type.
The rich carving, the perfect masonry, and the admirable composition of
the whole leading up to the central mass, indicate architectural ability
of a high order.</p>


<p><b>CHINESE ARCHITECTURE.</b> No purely Mongolian nation appears ever
to have erected buildings of first-rate importance. It cannot be denied,
however, that the Chinese are possessed of considerable decorative skill
and mechanical ingenuity; and these qualities are the most prominent
elements in their buildings. Great size and splendor, massiveness and
originality of construction, they do not possess. Built in large measure
of wood, cleverly framed and decorated
<span class = "pagenum">414</span>
<a name = "page414" id = "page414"> </a>
with a certain richness of color and ornament, with a large element of
the grotesque in the decoration, the Chinese temples, pagodas, and
palaces are interesting rather than impressive. There is not a single
architectural monument of imposing size or of great antiquity, so far as
we know. The celebrated <b>Porcelain Tower</b> of Nankin is no longer
extant, having been destroyed in the Tæping rebellion in 1850. It was a
nine-storied polygonal pagoda 236 feet high, revetted with porcelain
tiles, and was built in 1412. The largest of Chinese temples, that of
the <b>Great Dragon</b> at Pekin, is a circular structure of moderate
size, though its enclosure is nearly a mile square. Pagodas with
diminishing stories, elaborately carved entrance gates and successive
terraces are mainly relied upon for effect. They show little structural
art, but much clever ornament. Like the monasteries and the vast
<i>lamaseries</i> of Thibet, they belong to the Buddhist religion.</p>

<p>Aside from the ingenious framing and bracketing of the carpentry, the
most striking peculiarity of Chinese buildings is their broad-spreading
tiled roofs. These invariably slope downward in a curve, and the tiling,
with its hip-ridges, crestings, and finials in terra-cotta or metal,
adds materially to the picturesqueness of the general effect. Color and
gilding are freely used, and in some cases&mdash;as in a summer pavilion
at Pekin&mdash;porcelain tiling covers the walls, with brilliant effect.
The chief wonder is that this resource of the architectural decorator
has not been further developed in China, where porcelain and earthenware
are otherwise treated with such remarkable skill.</p>


<p><b>JAPANESE ARCHITECTURE.</b> Apparently associated in race with the
Chinese and Koreans, the Japanese are far more artistic in temperament
than either of their neighbors. The refinement and originality of their
decorative art have given it a wide reputation. Unfortunately the
prevalence of earthquakes has combined with the influence of the
traditional
<span class = "pagenum">415</span>
<a name = "page415" id = "page415"> </a>
habits of the people to prevent the maturing of a truly monumental
architecture. Except for the terraces, gates, and enclosures of their
palaces and temples, wood is the predominant building material. It is
used substantially as in China, the framing, dovetailing, bracketing,
broad eaves and tiled roofs of Japan closely resembling those of China.
The chief difference is in the greater refinement and delicacy of the
Japanese details and the more monumental disposition of the temple
terraces, the beauty of which is greatly enhanced by skillful landscape
gardening. The gateways recall somewhat those of the Sanchi Tope in
India (<a href = "#page403">p.&nbsp;403</a>), but are commonly of wood.
Owing to the danger from earthquakes, lofty towers and pagodas are
rarely seen.</p>

<p>The domestic architecture of Japan, though interesting for its
arrangements, and for its sensible and artistic use of the most flimsy
materials, is too trivial in scale, detail, and construction to receive
more than passing reference. Even the great palace at Tokio,<a class =
"tag" name = "tag28" id = "tag28" href = "#note28">28</a> covering an
immense area, is almost entirely composed of one-storied buildings of
wood, with little of splendor or architectural dignity.</p>

<p><a name = "appA" id = "appA">A.</a> <b>PRIMITIVE GREEK
ARCHITECTURE.</b>&mdash;The researches of Schliemann commented by
Schuchardt, of Dörpfeld, Stamakis, Tsoundas, Perrot, and others, in
Troy, Mycenæ, and Tiryns, and the more recent discoveries of Evans at
Gnossus, in Crete, have greatly extended our knowledge of the
prehistoric art of Greece and the Mediterranean basin, and established
many points of contact on the one hand with ancient Egyptian and
Phœnician art, and on the other, with the art of historic Greece. They
have proved the existence of an active and flourishing commerce between
Egypt and the Mediterranean shores and Aegean islands more than 2000
<span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>, and of a flourishing material
civilization in those islands and on the mainland of Greece, borrowing
much, but not everything, from Egypt. While the origin of the Doric
order in the structural methods of the pre-Homeric architecture of
Tiryns and Mycenæ, as set forth by Dörpfeld and by Perrot and Chipiez,
can hardly be regarded as proved in all details, since much of the
argument advanced for this derivation rests on more or less conjectural
restorations of the existing remains, it seems to be fairly well
established that the Doric order, and historic Greek architecture in
general, trace their genesis in large measure back in direct line to
this prehistoric art. The remarkable feature of this early architecture
is the apparently complete absence of temples. Fortifications, houses,
palaces, and tombs make up the ruins thus far discovered, and seem to
indicate clearly the derivation of the temple-type of later Greek art
from the primitive house, consisting of a hall or <i>megaron</i> with
four columns about the central hearth (whence
<span class = "pagenum">418</span>
<a name = "page418" id = "page418"> </a>
no doubt, the atrium and peristyle of Roman houses, through their Greek
intermediary prototypes) and a porch or <i>aithousa</i>, with or without
columns <i>in antis</i>, opening directly into the <i>megaron</i>, or
indirectly through an ante-room called the <i>prodomos</i>. Here we have
the prototypes of the Greek temple <i>in antis</i>, with its <i>naos</i>
having interior columns, whether roofed over or hypæthral (see pp. 54,
55). It is probable also that the evidently liberal use of timber for
many of the structural details led in time to many of the forms later
developed in stone in the entablature of the Doric order. But it is hard
to discover, as Dörpfeld would have it, in the slender Mycenæan columns
with their inverted taper, the prototype of the massive Doric column
with its upward taper. The Mycenæan column was evidently derived from
wooden models; the sturdy Doric column&mdash;the earliest being the most
massive&mdash;seems plainly derived from stone or rubble piers (see <a
href = "arch1.html#page50">p.&nbsp;50</a>), and thus to have come from a
different source from the Mycenæan forms.</p>

<p>The <i>gynecæum</i>, or women’s apartments, the men’s apartments, and
the bath were in these ancient palaces grouped in varying relations
about the <i>megaron</i>: their plan, purpose, and arrangement are
clearly revealed in the ruins of Tiryns, where they are more complete
and perfect than either at Troy or Mycenæ.</p>

ITALY.</b>&mdash;Reference is made on <a href =
"arch1.html#page264">page 264</a> to the towers or campaniles of the
Italian Gothic style and period, and six of these are specifically
mentioned; and on <a href = "#page305">page 305</a> mention is also made
of those of the Renaissance in Italy. The number and importance of the
Italian campaniles and the interest attaching to their origin and
design, warrant a more extended notice than has been assigned them in
the pages cited.</p>

<p>The oldest of these bell-towers appear to be those adjoining
<span class = "pagenum">419</span>
<a name = "page419" id = "page419"> </a>
the two churches of San Apollinare in and near Ravenna (see <a href =
"arch1.html#page114">p.&nbsp;114</a>), and date presumably from the
sixth century. They are plain circular towers with few and small
openings, except in the uppermost story, where larger arched openings
permit the issue of the sound of the bells. This type, which might have
been developed into a very interesting form of tower, does not seem to
have been imitated. It was at Rome, and not till the ninth or tenth
century, that the campanile became a recognized feature of church
architecture. It was invariably treated as a structure distinct from the
church, and was built of brick upon a square plan, rising with little or
no architectural adornment to a height usually of a hundred feet or
more, and furnished with but a few small openings below the belfry
stage, where a pair of coupled arched windows separated by a simple
column opened from each face of the tower. Above these windows a
pyramidal roof of low pitch terminated the tower. In spite of their
simplicity of design these Roman bell-towers often possess a noticeable
grace of proportions, and furnish the prototype of many of the more
elaborate campaniles erected during the Middle Ages in other central and
north Italian cities. The towers of Sta. Maria in Cosmedin, Sta. Maria
in Trastevere, and S.&nbsp;Giorgio in Velabro are examples of this type.
Most of the Roman examples date from the eleventh and twelfth
centuries.</p>

<p>In other cities, the campanile was treated with some variety of form
and decoration, as well as of material. In Lombardy and Venetia the
square red-brick shaft of the tower is often adorned with long, narrow
pilaster strips, as at Piacenza (p.&nbsp;158, <a href =
"arch1.html#fig91">Fig.&nbsp;91</a>) and Venice, and an arcaded cornice
not infrequently crowns the structure. The openings at the top may be
three or four in number on each face, and even the plan is sometimes
octagonal or circular. The brick octagonal campanile of
<b>S.&nbsp;Gottardo</b> at Milan is one of the finest Lombard church
towers. At Verona the
<span class = "pagenum">420</span>
<a name = "page420" id = "page420"> </a>
brick tower on the Piazza <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘dell ’Erbe’ with misplaced apostrophe">dell’ Erbe</ins> and
that of S.&nbsp;Zeno are conspicuous; but every important town of
northern Italy possesses one or more examples of these structures dating
from the eleventh, twelfth, or thirteenth century.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the three most noted bell-towers in Italy are those of
Venice, Pisa, and Florence. The great <b>Campanile</b> of <b>St.
Mark</b> at Venice, first begun in 874, carried higher in the twelfth
and fourteenth centuries, and finally completed in the sixteenth century
with the marble belvedere and wooden spire so familiar in pictures of
Venice, was formerly the highest of all church campaniles in Italy,
measuring approximately 325 feet to the summit. But this superb historic
monument, weakened by causes not yet at this writing fully understood,
fell in sudden ruin on the 14th of July, 1902, to the great loss not
only of Venice, but of the world of art, though fortunately without
injuring the neighboring buildings on the Piazza and Piazzetta of St.
Mark. Since then the campanile of S.&nbsp;Stefano, in the same city, has
been demolished to forestall another like disaster. The <b>Leaning
Tower</b> of Pisa (see p.&nbsp;160, <a href =
"arch1.html#fig92">Fig.&nbsp;92</a>) dates from 1174, and is unique in
its plan and its exterior treatment with superposed arcades. Begun
apparently as a leaning tower, it seems to have increased this lean to a
dangerous point, by the settling of its foundations during construction,
as its upper stages were made to deviate slightly towards the vertical
from the inclination of the lower portion. It has always served rather
as a watch-tower and belvedere than as a bell-tower. The
<b>Campanile</b> adjoining the Duomo at <b>Florence</b> is described on
<a href = "arch1.html#page263">p.&nbsp;263</a> and illustrated in <a
href = "arch1.html#fig154">Fig.&nbsp;154</a>, and does not require
further notice here. The black-and-white banded towers of Sienna, Lucca,
and Pistoia, and the octagonal lanterns crowning those of Verona and
Mantua, also referred to in the text on <a href =
"arch1.html#page264">p.&nbsp;264</a>, need here only be mentioned again
as illustrating the variety of treatment of these Italian towers.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">421</span>
<a name = "page421" id = "page421"> </a>
<p>The Renaissance architects developed new types of campanile, and in
such variety that they can only be briefly referred to. Some, like a
brick tower at Perugia, are simple square towers with pilasters; more
often engaged columns and entablatures mark the several stories, and the
upper portion is treated either with an octagonal lantern or with
diminishing stages, and sometimes with a spire. Of the latter class the
best example is that of S.&nbsp;Biagio, at Montepulciano,&mdash;one of
the two designed to flank the façade of Ant. da S.&nbsp;Gallo’s
beautiful church of that name. One or two good late examples are to be
found at Naples. Of the more massive square type there are examples in
the towers of S.&nbsp;Michele, Venice; of the cathedral at Ferrara, Sta.
Chiara at Naples, and Sta. Maria dell’ Anima&mdash;one of the
earliest&mdash;at Rome. The most complete and perfect of these square
belfries of the Renaissance is that of the <b>Campidoglio</b> at Rome,
by Martino Lunghi, dating from the end of the sixteenth century, which
groups so admirably with the palaces of the Capitol.</p>


<p><a name = "appC" id = "appC">C.</a> <b>BRAMANTE’S WORKS.</b>&mdash;A
more or less animated controversy has arisen regarding the authenticity
of many of the works attributed to Bramante, and the tendency has of
late been to deny him any part whatever in several of the most important
of these works. The first of these to be given a changed assignment was
the church of the Consolazione at Todi (<a href =
"#page293">p.&nbsp;293</a>), now believed to be by Cola di Caprarola;
and it is now denied by many investigators that either the Cancelleria
or the Giraud palace (<a href = "#page290">p.&nbsp;290</a>) is his work,
or any one of two or three smaller houses in Rome showing a somewhat
similar architectural treatment. The evidence adduced in support of this
denial is rather speculative and critical than documentary, but is not
without weight. The date 1495 carved on a doorway of the Cancelleria
palace is thought to forbid its attribution to
<span class = "pagenum">422</span>
<a name = "page422" id = "page422"> </a>
Bramante, who is not known to have come to Rome till 1503; and there is
a lack of positive evidence of his authorship of the Giraud palace and
the other houses which seem to be by the same hand as the Cancelleria.
To the advocates of this view there is not enough resemblance in style
between this group of buildings and his acknowledged work either in
Milan or in the Vatican to warrant their being attributed to him.</p>

<p>It must, however, be remarked, that this notable group of works,
stamped with the marks and even the mannerisms of a strong personality,
reveal in their unknown author gifts amounting to genius, and heretofore
deemed not unworthy of Bramante. It is almost inconceivable that they
should have been designed by a mere beginner previously utterly unknown
and forgotten soon after. It is incumbent upon those who deny the
attribution to Bramante to find another name, if possible, on which to
fasten the credit of these works. Accordingly, they have been variously
attributed to Alberti (who died in 1472) or his followers; to Bernardo
di Lorenzo, and to other later fifteenth-century artists. The difficulty
here is to discover any name that fits the conditions even as well as
Bramante’s; for the supposed author must have been in Rome between 1495
and 1505, and his other works must be at least as much like these as
were Bramante’s. No name has thus far been found satisfactory to careful
critics; and the alternative theory, that there existed in Rome, before
Bramante’s coming, a&nbsp;group of architects unknown to later fame,
working in a common style and capable of such a masterpiece as the
Cancelleria, does not harmonize with the generally accepted facts of
Renaissance art history. Moreover, the comparison of these works with
Bramante’s Milanese work on the one hand and his great Court of the
Belvedere in the Vatican on the other, yields, to some critics,
conclusions quite opposed to those of the advocates of another
authorship than Bramante’s.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">423</span>
<a name = "page423" id = "page423"> </a>
<p>The controversy must be considered for the present as still open.
There are manifest difficulties with either of the two opposed views,
and these can hardly be eliminated, except by the discovery of documents
not now known to exist, whose testimony will be recognized as
unimpeachable.</p>


<p><a name = "appD" id = "appD">D.</a> <b>L’ART NOUVEAU.</b>&mdash;Since
1896, and particularly since the Paris Exposition of 1900,
a&nbsp;movement has manifested itself in France and Belgium, and spread
to Germany and Austria and even measurably to England, looking towards a
more personal and original style of decorative and architectural design,
in which the traditions and historic styles of the past shall be
ignored. This movement has received from its adherents and the public
the name of “L’Art Nouveau,” or, according to some, “L’Art Moderne”; but
this name must not be held to connote either a really new style or a
fundamentally new principle in art. Indeed, it may be questioned whether
any clearly-defined body of principles whatever underlies the movement,
or would be acknowledged equally by all its adherents. It appears to be
a reaction against a too slavish adherence to traditional forms and
methods of design (see pp. <a href = "#page370">370</a>, <a href =
"#page375">375</a>), a&nbsp;striving to ignore or forget the past rather
than a reaching out after any well-understood, positive end; as such, it
possesses the negative strength of protest rather than the affirmative
strength of a vital principle. Its lack of cohesion is seen in the
division of its adherents into groups, some looking to nature for
inspiration, while others decry this as a mistaken quest; some seeking
to emphasize structural lines, and others to ignore them altogether.
All, however, are united in the avoidance of commonplace forms and
historic styles, and this preoccupation has developed an amazing amount
of originality and individualism of style, frequently reaching the
extreme of eccentricity. The results have therefore been, as might be
expected, extremely varied in
<span class = "pagenum">424</span>
<a name = "page424" id = "page424"> </a>
merit, ranging from the most refined and reserved in style to the most
harshly bizarre and extravagant. As a rule, they have been most
successful in small and semi-decorative objects&mdash;jewelry,
silverware, vases, and small furniture; and one most desirable feature
of the movement has been the stimulus it has given (especially in France
and England), to the organization and activity of “arts-and-crafts”
societies which occupy themselves with the encouragement of the
decorative and industrial arts and the diffusion of an improved taste.
In the field of the larger objects of design, in which the dominance of
traditional form and of structural considerations is proportionally more
imperious, the struggle to evade these restrictions becomes more
difficult, and results usually in more obvious and disagreeable
eccentricities, which the greater size and permanence of the object tend
further to exaggerate. The least successful achievements of the movement
have accordingly been in architecture. The buildings designed by its
most fervent disciples (<i>e.g.</i> the Pavillon Bleu at the Exposition
of 1900, the Castel Béranger, Paris, by <i>H.&nbsp;Guimard</i>, the
houses of the artist colony at Darmstadt, and others) are for the most
part characterized by extreme stiffness, eccentricity, or ugliness. The
requirements of construction and of human habitation cannot easily be
met without sometimes using the forms which past experience has
developed for the same ends; and the negation of precedent is not the
surest path to beauty or even reasonableness of design. It is
interesting to notice that in the intermediate field of furniture-design
some of the best French productions recall the style of Louis XV.,
modified by Japanese ideas and spirit. This singular but not unpleasing
combination is less surprising when we reflect that the style of Louis
XV. was itself a protest against the formalism of the heavy classic
architecture of preceding reigns, and achieved its highest successes in
the domain of furniture and interior decoration.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">425</span>
<a name = "page425" id = "page425"> </a>
<p>It may be fair to credit the new movement with one positive
characteristic in its prevalent regard for line, especially for the
effect of long and swaying lines, whether in the contours or
ornamentation of an object. This is especially noticeable in the Belgian
work, and in that of the Viennese “Secessionists,” who have, however,
carried eccentricity to a further point of extravagance than any
others.</p>

<p>Whether “L’Art Nouveau” will ever produce permanent results time
alone can show. Its present vogue is probably evanescent and it cannot
claim to have produced a style; but it seems likely to exert on European
architecture an influence, direct and indirect, not unlike that of the
Néo-Grec movement of 1830 in France (<a href =
"#page364">p.&nbsp;364</a>), but even more lasting and beneficial. It
has already begun to break the hold of rigid classical tradition in
design; and recent buildings, especially in Germany and Austria, like
the works of the brilliant <i>Otto Wagner</i> in Vienna, show a pleasing
freedom of personal touch without undue striving after eccentric
novelty. Doubtless in French and other European architecture the same
result will in time manifest itself.</p>

<p>The search for novelty and the desire to dispense wholly with
historic forms of design which are the chief marks of the Art <ins class
= "correction" title = "text reads ‘Noveau’">Nouveau</ins>, were
emphatically displayed in many of the remarkable buildings of the Paris
<b>Exhibition of 1900</b>, in which a striking fertility and facility of
design in the decorative details made more conspicuous the failure to
improve upon the established precedents of architectural style in the
matters of proportion, scale, general composition, and contour. As usual
the metallic construction of these buildings was almost without
exception admirable, and the decorative details, taken by themselves,
extremely clever and often beautiful, but the combined result was not
satisfactory.</p>

<p>In the United States the movement has not found a firm foothold
because there has been no dominant, enslaving tradition to protest
against. Not a few of the ideas, not a
<span class = "pagenum">426</span>
<a name = "page426" id = "page426"> </a>
little of the spirit of the movement may be recognized in the work of
individual architects and decorative artists in the United States,
executed years before the movement took recognizable form in Europe: and
American decorative design has generally been, at least since 1880 or
1885, sufficiently free, individual and personal, to render unnecessary
and impossible any concerted movement of artistic revolt against slavery
to precedent.</p>


<p><a name = "appE" id = "appE">E.</a> <b>RECENT AMERICAN
ARCHITECTURE.</b>&mdash;Architectural activity in the United States
continues to share in the general prosperity which has marked the years
since 1898, and this activity has by no means been confined to
industrial and commercial architecture. Indeed, while the erection of
“sky scrapers” or excessively lofty office-buildings has continued to be
a feature of this activity in the great commercial centres, the most
notable architectural enterprises of recent years have been in the field
of educational buildings, both in the East and West. In 1898 a great
international competition resulted in the selection of the design of Mr.
<i>E.&nbsp;Bénard</i> of Paris for a magnificent group of buildings for
the <b>University of California</b> on a scale of unexampled grandeur,
and the erection of this colossal project has been begun. An almost
equally ambitious project, by a firm of Philadelphia architects, has
been adopted for the Washington University at St. Louis; and many other
universities and colleges have either added extensively to their
existing buildings or planned an entire rebuilding on new designs. Among
these the national military and naval academies at <b>West Point</b> and
<b>Annapolis</b> take the first rank in the extent and splendor of the
projected improvements. Museums and libraries have also been erected or
begun in various cities, and the <b>New York Public Library</b>, now
building, will rank in cost and beauty with those already erected in
Boston and Washington.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">427</span>
<a name = "page427" id = "page427"> </a>
<p>In other departments mention should be made of recent Federal
buildings (custom-houses, post-offices, and court-houses) erected under
the provisions of the Tarsney act from designs secured by competition
among the leading architects of the country; among those the <b>New York
Custom House</b> is the most important, but other buildings, at
Washington, Indianapolis, and elsewhere, are also conspicuous, and many
of them worthy of high praise. The tendency to award the designing of
important public buildings, such as State capitols, county court houses,
city halls, libraries, and hospitals, by competition instead of by
personal and political favor, has resulted in a marked improvement in
the quality of American public architecture.</p>

INVESTIGATIONS.</b>&mdash;During the past two years, extensive repairs
and partial restorations of the Erechtheum at Athens, undertaken by the
Greek Archæological Society, have afforded opportunities for a new and
thoroughgoing study of the existing portions of the building and of the
surrounding ruins. In these investigations a prominent part has been
borne by Mr. Gorham P.&nbsp;Stevens, representing the Archæological
Institute of America, to whom must be credited, among other things, the
demonstration of the existence, in the east wall of the original
structure, of two windows previously unknown. Other peculiarities of
design and construction were also discovered, which add greatly to the
interest of the building. These investigations are reported in the
